Still TODO for eyetribe interface:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Determine what config file settings (and associated values) will be supported.
     - Modify default_eyetracker.yaml and supported_config_settings.yaml
       in theeyetribe folder as necessary

- In theeyetribe/eyetracker.py make changes as necessary to use the eye tracker
  config settings.

- Convert native eyetroibe samples into iohub binocular sample event arrays.

- implement other incomplete iohub eyetracker interface methods:
      - list them here

- create framework for monitoring and handling error codes from the eyetribe.

- handle situtations:
    - eyetribe can not be connected at startup
    - eye tribe is disonnected during runtime of experiment
    - eyetribe does not send samples when it is set to.
    - other ????
 
- implement calibration routine
      - backend logic
      - graphics for calibration display. 
        (would like to try to do a psychopy process side graphics implementation)
