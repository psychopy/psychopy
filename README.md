PsychoPy is an open-source package for creating experiments in behavioral science. It aims to provide a single package that is:

* precise enough for psychophysics
* easy enough for teaching
* flexible enough for everything else
* able to run experiments in a local Python script or online in JavaScript

To meet these goals PsychoPy provides a choice of interface - you can use a
simple graphical user interface called Builder, or write your experiments in
Python code. The entire application and library are written in Python and is
platform independent.
