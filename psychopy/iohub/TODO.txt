TODO list for the isolver/psychopy lazyimport branch

- Complete iohub pep8 formatting w/ manual fixing of long line wraps *

- Update docstrs (add, review for errors, simplify)*

- Unit Tests to cover >= 75% of iohub source. *

- Full merciless API review: *
    - Focus on main point: Asynchronous device control and event reporting.
    - Get consistent, drop bloat.
    - Deprecate complex in favor of simpler and/or more generic replacements.

* These tasks should have a priority focus on the public / user level API
  in the following sections:
    - iohub/__init__.py
    - iohub/constants.py

    - [Done] Complete removal of iohub.client.expruntime.py
    - iohub.datastore.util.py
    - iohub.datastore.pandas.*
  + Move code to 'unsupported' external modules if / when needed.
    Document ref's to alternative api's to use instead

            - experiment and session meta data
            - condition variables table
            - hdf5 file structure
            - reading data / doing analysis from hdf5 files

- Review, update, simplify iohub examples in Coder and Builder.
  a) [Done] Always use launchHubServer
  b) Make each as simple as possible
  c) Remove any unnecessary demos

- Python 3.4+ support

- Some bigger issues that would be good to address:
    - Consistent iohub Error / exception reporting framework:
        - communication of issues to client process.
        - reporting of issues by client process
    - Consistent device status reporting after client starts iohub process.
    - Create files in user writable folder (use OS specific standard folders)
    - [Done] How iohub subprocess starts and how client knows server is ready:
        -  remove use of pipe for this.

- Keep ioHub Release Notes release_notes.rst updated.
