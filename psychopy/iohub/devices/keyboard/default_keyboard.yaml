# This file includes all valid Keyboard Device

Keyboard:
    # name: The name you want to assign the keyboard device for the experiment
    #   This name is what will be used to access the device within the experiment
    #   script via the devices.[device_name] property of the ioHubConnection or
    #   ioHubExperimentRuntime classes.
    #
    name: keyboard

    # enable: Specifies if the device should be enabled by ioHub and monitored
    #   for events.
    #   True = Enable the device on the ioHub Server Process
    #   False = Disable the device on the ioHub Server Process. No keyboard events will
    #   be reported by the ioHub Server.
    #
    enable: True
 
    #   monitor_event_types: Specified which KeyboardEvent types should be monitored
    #   for and therefore saved to the DataStore or sent to the Experiment Process.
    #
    monitor_event_types: [KeyboardPressEvent, KeyboardReleaseEvent]

    # report_auto_repeat_press_events: Should the keyboard report key press events
    #   that are generated by the OS when a key is held down for an extended 
    #   period of time.
    #
    report_auto_repeat_press_events: False

    # report_system_wide_events: Should the keyboard report events
    #   even when the OS window target is not a PsychoPy Window? 
    #   True: All events will be reported regardless of window target.
    #   False: Only events indicating that a PsychoPy Window
    #       is the intended event target will be reported.
    report_system_wide_events: True

    # use_keymap: What key map set / heuristics should be used? Options:
    #   psychopy: Use key map that is the same as used by event.getKeys()
    #   legacy: Use original iohub key map
    use_keymap: legacy

    # save_events: *If* the ioHubDataStore is enabled for the experiment, then
    #   indicate if events for this device should be saved to the
    #   data_collection/keyboard event group in the hdf5 event file.
    #   True = Save events for this device to the ioDataStore.
    #   False = Do not save events for this device in the ioDataStore.
    #
    save_events: True

    # stream_events: Indicate if events from this device should be made available
    #   during experiment runtime to the Experiment / PsychoPy Process.
    #   True = Send events for this device to  the Experiment Process in real-time.
    #   False = Do *not* send events for this device to the Experiment Process in real-time.
    #
    stream_events: True

    # auto_report_events: Indicate if events from this device should start being
    #   processed by the ioHub as soon as the device is loaded at the start of an experiment,
    #   or if events should only start to be monitored on the device when a call to the
    #   device's enableEventReporting method is made with a parameter value of True.
    #   True = Automatically start reporting events for this device when the experiment starts.
    #   False = Do not start reporting events for this device until enableEventReporting(True)
    #       is set for the device during experiment runtime.
    #
    auto_report_events: True

    # event_buffer_length: Specify the maximum number of events (for each
    #   event type the device produces) that can be stored by the ioHub Server
    #   before each new event results in the oldest event of the same type being
    #   discarded from the ioHub device event buffer.
