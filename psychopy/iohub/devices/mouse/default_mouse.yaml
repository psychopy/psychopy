# This file includes all valid Mouse Device
# settings that can be specified in an iohub_config.yaml
# or in Python dictionary form and passed to the launchHubServer
# method. Any device parameters not specified when the device class is
# created by the ioHub Process will be assigned the default value
# indicated here.
#
Mouse:
    # name: The name you want to assign the Mouse device for the experiment
    #   This name is what will be used to access the device within the experiment
    #   script via the devices.[device_name] property of the ioHubConnection or
    #   ioHubExperimentRuntime classes.
    #
    name: mouse

    # enable: Specifies if the device should be enabled by ioHub and monitored
    #   for events.
    #   True = Enable the device on the ioHub Server Process
    #   False = Disable the device on the ioHub Server Process. No mouse events will
    #   be reported by the ioHub Server.
    #
    enable: True

    # monitor_event_types: *If* the ioHubDataStore is enabled for the experiment, then
    #   indicate if events for this device should be saved to the
    #   monitor_event_types: Specified which Mouse Event types should be monitored
    #   for and therefore saved to the DataStore or sent to the Experiment Process.
    #
    monitor_event_types:  [MouseMoveEvent, MouseDragEvent, MouseScrollEvent, MouseButtonPressEvent, MouseButtonReleaseEvent, MouseMultiClickEvent]

    #   save_events: Save Mouse events to the data_collection/Mouse event
    #   group in the hdf5 event file.
    #   True = Save events for this device to the ioDataStore.
    #   False = Do not save events for this device in the ioDataStore.
    #
    save_events: True

    # report_system_wide_events: Should the mouse report events
    #   even when the OS window target is not a PsychoPy Window?
    #   True: All events will be reported regardless of window target.
    #   False: Only events indicating that a PsychoPy Window
    #       is the intended event target will be reported.
    report_system_wide_events: True


    # enable_multi_window: If True, iohub Mouse can be used with multi-window,
    #   or non full screen window, experiments. If mouse is over a PsychoPy window,
    #   position is reported as window pixel position; window center as origin (0, 0).
    #   window_id is set to the psychopy window handle. If mouse is not over psychopy window,
    #   position is left in desktop pixels and window_id is set to 0.
    #   If False (default), only a single full screen window is supported
    #   and original mouse position mapping logic is used.
    enable_multi_window: False

    # stream_events: Indicate if events from this device should be made available
    #   during experiment runtime to the Experiment / PsychoPy Process.
    #   True = Send events for this device to  the Experiment Process in real-time.
    #   False = Do *not* send events for this device to the Experiment Process in real-time.
    #
    stream_events: True

    # auto_report_events: Indicate if events from this device should start being
    #   processed by the ioHub as soon as the device is loaded at the start of an experiment,
    #   or if events should only start to be monitored on the device when a call to the
    #   device's enableEventReporting method is made with a parameter value of True.
    #   True = Automatically start reporting events for this device when the experiment starts.
    #   False = Do not start reporting events for this device until enableEventReporting(True)
    #       is set for the device during experiment runtime.
    #
    auto_report_events: True

    # event_buffer_length: Specify the maximum number of events (for each
    #   event type the device produces) that can be stored by the ioHub Server
    #   before each new event results in the oldest event of the same type being
    #   discarded from the ioHub device event buffer.
    #
    event_buffer_length: 256

    # device_number: The device number to assign to the device.
    #   Device_number is not used by this device type.
    #
    device_number: 0

    # The device manufacturer's name.
    #   It is not used by the ioHub, so is FYI only.
    #
    manufacturer_name: N/A
