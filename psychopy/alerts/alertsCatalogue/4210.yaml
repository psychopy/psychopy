label: Probable syntax error detected in your JavaScript code

synopsis: |
  JavaScript syntax error found in your code component.

solutions: |
  Check the code carefully at the indicated line and on the few lines above. Check especially for things like un-matched parentheses or quote symbols.

versions: |
  All versions.
