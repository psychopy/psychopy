Changelog
=========

PsychoPy uses **major.minor.patch** version numbers:

- All changes to **major.minor** numbers indicate that changes are expected to change the behavior of PsychoPy experiments
- Changes to the **patch** version number are relativel minor bug fixes and we hope they do not change behavior

Updating without breaking existing studies
------------------------------------------

We **strongly recommend** that, once your experiment is finished and is being run "for real",
that you apply the :ref:`useVersion <useVersion>` setting so that your study will always try
to run on the same PsychoPy version even where a different version is installed on the computer.
That setting often even allows PsychoPy to run experiments from versions that have not yet
been installed! If the dependencies haven't changed it will run.

PsychoPy 2024.1
-----------------

**Highlights:**

* **Counterbalance Routine**: Standalone Routine to handle counterbalancing *between participants*, using the "shelf" to maintain records inbetween
* **Piloting Mode**: Run experiments in "piloting" mode - adjusts settings to avoid common pitfalls while you're building (e.g. getting stuck in a full screen experiment), then switch to "running" when you're ready to start gathering data
* **Improved UI**: Toolbars across the app have a clearer layout for buttons and a more intuitive interface for Pavlovia. Runner especially has had a visual overhaul, with a lot more space for reading stdout/alerts and a new output specifically for Pavlovia sync messages.
* **Fixes to Eye tracker plugins**: Several eye trackers had not been working since being moved out to plugins and these should all now be back in operation

PsychoPy 2023.2
---------------

**Highlights:**

* Routine settings: Routines now have parameters of their own, giving control over their max duration, skipping the Routine altogether, or changing the way the window looks just for that Routine.
* Sort by priority: Columns in the data file can now be given a "priority" value, with the option to sort by priority instead of chronologically.
* Whisper transcription PLUGIN for Microphone: Using the OpenAI backend, Microphone transcriptions can be done quicker and more accurately, and include timing info for each word.
* Progress bar component: A visual component to show progress along an axis.
* Builder search dialog: Search for values across your whole experiment, then jump to the specific Routine/Component where it's present. Makes debugging much easier.
* Most stimuli now support a `draggable` attribute. If set to `draggable=True` then that stimulus should check/update position on each frame using `stim.doDragging()`

**Behaviour changes:**

* Eyetrackers (Tobii, SRR Eyelink, Gazepoint, PupilLabs) are now plugins rather than built-in, in keeping with the drive to cut down the dependencies of core PsychoPy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/compare/2023.2.2...2023.2.3

PsychoPy 2023.1
---------------

**Release series 2023.1. Highlights**

- **Pavlovia Surveys:** can now be integrated into PsychoPy online studies. You still create your
  survey in the Pavlovia Survey Creator (on you Pavlovia Dashboard) but you can then incorporate
  them as either a link or an embedded json file into your PsychoJS study. This only works for
  online studies at present
- **Panorama Stimuli:** now supported in PsychoPy (lab-based) studies. You can add a photo-sphere 
  as a stimulus (e.g. create them in Street View app on Android phones) and then insert them into 
  Builder and explore
- **Plugins and Packages:** You can now add packages to your PsychoPy installation with a GUI that
  installs new packages to your user folder (without needing admin rights). Some of PsychoPy's
  existing functionality has also moved out to "Plugins"

    - For users, plugins mean more control over what functionality you want PsychoPy to support
    - For developers, plugins mean keeping more independence over your code and ownership

- **Speech Point:** on TextBox allows a tail to be added giving the impression of a cartoon speech
  bubble (lab-based only, currently)
- **MovieStim:** further improvements to performance and fixes

PsychoPy 2022.3
---------------

**Highlights:**
- Online: Interface in Pavlovia for building and running online questionnaires! As this is built on top of the
  open-source [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/) package it offers a rich feature list right off the bat. The new
  Pavlovia Survey component you can insert a survey into your experiment just like you would a Form component.
- Python: New Panorama component lets you view a Photo Sphere image as a 3d scene within Python experiments.
- Python: New style for slider:
    - **choice**: Hides the Slider line and replaces the marker with a focus box which sits behind the labels.
- Python: New control types added to Form component:
    - **dropdown**: A drop-down menu, essentially a Button stimulus showing the current value which, on click, reveals
      a Slider with style set to **choice**.
    - **checkbox / bool**: A tick box for simple yes/no questions
- Python: Textboxes now have the option to hide overflowing text and/or to show a vertical scrollbar.
- Python: PsychoPy windows can now have a background image, settable in the Experiment Settings.
- Online: PsychoJS end message now customisable via Experiment Settings.
- App: Accessibility enhancements, making it easier to navigate menus and dialog boxes using just the keyboard.

PsychoPy 2022.2
---------------

*Highlights:*

- BETA: Cameras can now be accessed during your experiments (in web-based and in local experiments) and allow

    - saving recordings to disk
    - showing the current input from the webcam (make the Camera the input to a regular ImageStim)
    - replaying a recording later in the experiment (use the Camera as input to a subsequent MovieStim)
    - **all the above features are currently BETA**

- Python: New movie *playing* engine for higher performance playback in locally experiments (using FFPyPlayer)
- Online: Introducing the "Shelf" for persistent storage on Pavlovia of variables accessible to a range
  of scopes (only the current participant, only the current project, any project in the lab etc.). 
  This may sound like not a big deal but it opens options for the following:

    - **multi-session** studies: retrieve the participant threshold/progress form last session
    - **interactive multi-player** studies: store 'messages' for another user to receive
    - **counterbalancing online**: by tracking the number of participants that have been in each group

- Online: Gratings and Gabors now supported online, straight from your Builder experiments
- Online: gamma correction supported in the browser(!!) by setting Window.gamma property (currently
  requires a code snippet)
- Local: Builder now has a Serial Port Component to make it easier to connect to hardware without needing
  Code Components

**Compatibility changes:**

- App: Studies with Code Components that access `routineTimer` will need adapting because the non-slip Builder
  logic has changed this is now a regular (count-up) Clock instead of a CountdownTimer

**Key Fixes:**

- Online: Button Component is now fully working, so you don't need to create your own text boxes for this
- Online: Routines used outside a loop now always advance the next row in the data file so that they
  can't overwrite each others' data
- Python: The `.stopped` times should now be showing up correctly for all Components in the csv file
  (they were always correct in the log file)
- Python: Better timing in non-slip Routines. Previously the non-slip timer corrected for overshoots but
  not undershoots. This is now fixed.
- Python: 3D rendering should be working again.

**Also:**

- `Is trials` property of loops (to control whether the data file advances) is now supported
  in online studies

  wait until the resource is fully received if it takes longer than the set
  duration. Using ResourceManager components the experiment will not freeze but
  status can be checked `status==FINISHED` when download is complete
- Fixed a bug where, after logging out of the Pavlovia Session in the PsychoPy
  interface, PsychoPy would still provide the option to use the names/groups of
  that user, but would not then allow access to their contents.

PsychoPy 2021.1
---------------

The first major release of 2021 brings a lot of fixes (the dev team is focussing heavily on making the user experience more smooth at the moment).

On top of those fixes are a number of useful additions though, like the new :ref:`buttonComponent`.

NEW:

- Builder has a :ref:`buttonComponent` to make it easier to have clickable image/text objects
- Builder: Improved layout of Component dialogs:
  
    - Consistent tabs for common parameters (like pos, size, color...)
    - Component parameters that use filenames (sounds, images, etc.) now have a Browse... button
    - Component parameters that use Excel files now have an “open in Excel” button, if you click this when the field is blank it will open a pre-made template for you
    - Component parameters that are colors now have a button to open the color picker

- Builder now features separate compile buttons for JS and Py and will open the JS file in the Coder view when compiled
- Builder readme files now support markdown formatting (and .md extensions) psychopy/psychopy#3377
- PsychoPy lib: refactored color handling via the :class:`~psychopy.colors.Color` class

CHANGES (compatibility issues):

- CHANGED: the new more-flexible parameters of PsychoPy Experiment Components makes experiments from 2021.1 **will not run** on older versions of PsychoPy. If you share your study with people using older versions make sure you set the :ref:`useVersion` setting to be 2021.1.0 or upwards so that it will run elsewhere
- CHANGED: PsychoJS: orientation for PsychoJS now follows clock convention rather than engineering convention (polar coordinates, positive rotation is anti-clockwise) whereas PsychoPy used the clock convention. From this release onwards both use the clock convention or orientation/rotation.
- CHANGED: Slider has additional params for colors and fonts of lines/labels/marker that will not exist on older installations
- CHANGED: BufferImageStim was using an incorrect rect specification for selecting the region of the screen - it was using a bottom-left instead of PsychoPy standard center #3597

PsychoPy 2021.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXES:

- All: Curly quotation marks (“”), which are sometimes automatically put into text boxes by MacOS and certain keyboard settings, will now be automatically replaced with regular quotation marks (“) when in code. To use curly quotation marks still, you can “escape” them by putting a \ before them.
- Lib: Fixed syntax warnings on Python 3.8 #3344

PsychoPy 2020.2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXES:

- **Mac version now fully signed and notarized for GateKeeper!** For some time it's been an annoyance that Apple would block PsychoPy because of it not being from a "known developer" but in recent updates GateKeeper has become so aggressive the app has been crashing on startup for some macOS versions. Hopefully Apple will now let us launch in peace!
- **better handling of non-loading fonts in the application** On mac some fonts weren't being found (although this *might* be due to the now-solved gatekeeper issue)

- various fixes and additions to Japanese translations


PsychoPy 2020.1
----------------

For the new decade we have a new version system. The application is still called PsychoPy3 for now,
but we're using `year.version.bugfix` from now on to mark versions.

NEW FEATURES:

- Many exciting tools for 3D rendering. See Coder demos menu for some examples
- Online studies have better cross-browser compatibility including fixed support for edge
- Auto-translate Code Components Py-?JS (syntax only)
- Online studies have substantially improve timing. In fact, PsychoPy now has the
  `best timing of any online system, consistently under 4ms precision for RTs! <https://psyarxiv.com/d6nu5/>`_
- New Runner dialog:
    - provides some 'Alerts' about things that might go wrong in their study #2646
    - allows you to run/save/open a set of studies without opening a window for each one
    - allows online studies to run locally in "debug" mode to test the study before uploading

- Online studies now support shapes Cross, Star and regular polygons (nVertices) #2673
- Support for pyglet 1.4, including support for **text alignment in multi-line text** #2693
- CHANGED: rendering of text stimuli may not look quite the same. We now have new parameters
  `anchorHoriz` and `TextAlign` rather than `alignHoriz` but this may not act the same in all
  cases #2693
- Online studies no longer require a separate `html` folder.  #2687 In some cases (e.g. when adding extra resource files)
  it may be preferable to keep the html folder and that's currently still the default
  for new studies but ExperimentSettings>online>folder can now be set to blank and the html/js
  files will be saved alongside the psyexp/py files. This reduces file duplication.
- Support for QUESTplus staircases
- Pyglet backend now supports 10-bit framebuffer #2672
- Updated support for Oculus Rift #2655
- Added a :class:`~psychopy.visual.Pie` (pacman) stimulus #2652
- Substantially faster rendering of DotStim #2647

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Keypad key responses were not showing up as numbered responses under the new Keyboard class #2812
- Cedrus button box had an error int he Builder-output code added in 2020.1.1 #186ec587634
- Code Component was accidentally *forcing* people to use code auto-conversion #5c57d0c9d

PsychoPy 2020.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- Several tweaks to the new Runner dialog:
    - Double-click takes you back to the file in the appropriate Builder/Coder view
    - Ctrl-R within the Runner run the file (so you can do Ctrl-R twice from builder and you're running)
    - Alerts separated from stdout so they're more visible
    - Alerts for Builder are checked on experiemnt selection rather than on script compile time
    - Alert was testing stim size/pos incorrectly if using units "from experiment settings"

- Mac keyboard access should now bring up a dialog taking you to the correct System Preferences panel
- Fixes to Eyelink 1000 communications from iohub #1a8c6923b0
- Better support for high-res displays on Windows #2795
- Further tweak to readline issues on linux #6975040fae #4a80060b94

PsychoPy 2020.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- Tab key was incorrectly reporting itself as 'escape' in new Keyboard object #2620
- many more!
- Cedrus response box can be inserted into multiple routines without having to use a Code Component (no "Could not find a Cedrus device" error)


PsychoPy 3.2
----------------

PsychoPy 3.2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- Mitigated the gamma get/set fails caused by Microsoft Windows release 1903. PsychoPy
    - now avoids using these calls unless gamma-setting is really needed
    - gives more info about the cause. See more info in [troubleshooting gamma ramp](https://www.psychopy.org/troubleshooting.html#errors-with-getting-setting-the-gamma-ramp)
    - provides an option to skip gamma-setting entirely
- Slider wasn't allowing the units to be "from experiment settings" #23d80b49f
- Setting the conditions rows from another conditions file was causing "Error path is on mount... start on mount..." #2e8cd2183
- Mac 'tab' key was reporting itself as 'escape' with new Keyboard #95326cadd
- PSTBox Python3 incompatibility (although there may be more) #da83429d6

- Builder under OS X was not launching experiments if filename contained a space #1b205df

PsychoPy 3.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python2 installations crashed when trying to launch studies from Builder due to the use of a modern argument to subprocess not supported by Python2 #2596
- If Builder script had an error, then printing of that error was sometimes being split across the output frame (of Builder) and the output panel of Coder #2594

PsychoPy 3.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's all about the new timing improvements!

PsychoPy 3.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TIMING improvements:

- **new Sound backend 'PTB' which is much faster** than any of the alternatives on all operating systems (using the C code from Psychtoolbox thanks to Mario Kleiner) :
   - when combined with pre-scheduling (e.g. start playback on upcoming win.flip()) this can generate sub-ms precision and sub-ms lag!
   - works with standard audio hardware
- **better timing of visual stimuli** when timing by 'secs' (rather than frames):
   - new feature to request info from the Window about next expected flip
   - t in a Builder scripts is now time from first frame (so synched to visual stims)
- **better timing on the keyboard responses** of the JavaScript experiments due to timestamping asynchronously with your script

Also ADDED:

- Standalone installations now provide an updated Cedrus library, pyxid2
- Support for new LabHackers TTL2USB8 device (parallel port alternative)
- Envelope grating now has exponent (power) option

FIXED:

- Long-standing issue with lots of print-statements (e.g. on every frame) crashing Builder scripts
- Support for Pyglet 1.4 (although text scaling appears to have changed a little)
- Some serial devices (photometers) were not compatible with Python3 string/bytes
  conversion
- Too many more to mention...!

PsychoPy 3.1
----------------

We've improved keyboard timing a great deal.

As of PsychoPy 3.1 we are now using the underlying code of the `kbQueue` calls in
`Psychophysics Toolbox`. The C code from those calls was ported to a new Python
package in late 2018 and this is now the basis of the new :class:`Keyboard` class.
This only works on 64-bit Python3 installations, but the Keyboard class will
fall back to the old `event.GetKeys` calls where the `psychtoolbox` package is
not available.

PsychoPy 3.1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- new rendering glitch in ImageStim when mask=None and interpolate=True, caused by previous fix to the wrapping issue #2526

PsychoPy 3.1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- further fix to Mic for experiments created under the previous version (our last fix only solved the problem for new
  Mic Components being inserted) #2512
- fixed demo timeByFrames which was set to use Qt4 for plotting instead of Qt5 (which has been the default version
  provided since the switch to Python3)
- fixed crash in the new Keyboard class caused by `psychtoolbox` lib incorrectly converting unicode characters in the
  device name (this was actually a fix in #kleinerm/Psychtoolbox-3@a5c37855a4a097) that needed repackaging
- error with Variable Component trying to save start/stop times (that might not exist for that variable) #e1bca1bdc
- some data could get orphaned (and not saved) by being collected in the outer section of a nested loop #8b7fda826
- when using Mouse.getPos() with retina display and win.units=='pix' the mouse pos was double the expected value #a78d74420

PsychoPy 3.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- StairHandler code from Builder was failing in 3.1 due to new tStartRefresh
  data being sent to wrong method (addData not addOtherData) #2497
- Routines in online studies that weren't included in (or before) a loop were
  not having their data saved #2496
- Fix to audio capture error "bad argument at position 0" from Builder experiments #dadb9be25
- PsychoPy app didn't recognise projects that were pointing to gitlab ssh targets (e.g. created in terminal) #08d7937

PsychoPy 3.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- teething problems with new :class:`~psychopy.hardware.Keyboard`:

   - in Builder there was stuttering of sounds and lags in frame timing caused
     by accidentally creating lots of Kyeboards while checking for 'escape'
   - durations were being reported with correct magnitude but as negative values #e43e474602b7f
   - problem on Windows if keyboard device name contained unicode (that problem
     was actually in psychtoolbox package, now updated in Standalone)
   - on Windows, the 'return' key was being called 'num_enter'

- videos were not running online #9779579b60 #51b0824f755
- fixed rounding error in filtering of NoiseStim #5d0e360d87b
- iohub `waitKeys` should act like `getKeys` if maxWait<=0 #e33f733f317de
- error if unicode items in the new Form class #8287674f49a4c8

ADDED:

- videos in Builder now have a `Loop playback` parameter
- Standalone distributions now include tobii-research package

PsychoPy 3.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ADDED:

- Added the loop playback parameter to Movie Components

FIXED:

- Microphone on windows failed if user didn't manually set pyo to be preferred lib. That isn't now needed #700b72cd6
- pyo lib is now provided in the 64 bit Python3 Standalone (win)
- The new Keyboard class wasn't clearing all events when requested (e.g. at the beginning of stimulus onset) #2442
- Parallel port lib in the Windows 32-bit version wasn't working (installed a new dll)
- OpenCV in Mac Standalone wasn't working (updated to be a package not a single file)
- Sounds with variable duration didn't stop properly #2446
- Fix to JS output when useVersion was set to something
- Cedrus XID lib is now working on Python3 (although their official one is yet to come)

PsychoPy 3.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NEW:

- hardware.keyboard.Keyboard class, based on C code from the Psychtoolbox project (ported to Python by Mario Kleiner)

 - faster than `event.getKeys()` (polling is asynchronous with drawing loop and the calls go direct
   to the USB rather than going via the operating system key calls)
 - supports keyDuration fields as well as `rt` for key down time

- Form class for combining text items and responses (currently ratings and radio items) in a scrollable list
- each Builder Component is now outputting its start/stop times in the data file by default (can be turned
  off for )


PsychoPy 3.0
----------------

PsychoPy3 is the new phase of development including support for online studies
at the Pavlovia.org experiment server. Many of the features here are relatively
new and, although we have spent hundreds of hours developing and testing them
you should be more cautious than ever checking your experiment and data outputs.

- set Slider label height to match tick height by default #f8bdf2341
- online sounds were never ending if duration was blank (now ends at end of file) #6d91b3186
- problem converting EOLs between different formats when pasting code

ADDED:

- New Builder Pavlovia button to examine properties of current project
- Added star to ShapeStim (currently only in Python) #8e6c40993
- Added tooltips for Pavlovia buttons

PsychoPy 3.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CHANGED: Slight change to creation of *new* experiments, which will now default to
the units of 'height' rather than 'use preferences' (which led to potential confusion
when the experiment moved to a different computer)

FIXED:

- Force End Routine wasn't working with Slider when online #a0ca2e312
- Fix to the online error about units: if an experiment is given units of "use preferences"

- sounddevice under Python2 had a bug with being unable to copy() #c1317b6b6355e
- now prevent the user from accessing `useVersion` if that version can't be supported by the current install (e.g. incompatible Python version or wx version)
- Windows Standalone version now includes dependency for [pyqmix](https://github.com/psyfood/pyqmix) pumps

PsychoPy 3.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  flexible and simpler to use)
  - support for Oculus Rift (only on Windows 64bit Python 3) all due to Matthew
  Cutone

Many bugs have also been fixed, notably in terms of audio library problems and
memory problems with MovieStim3.


PsychoPy 3.0.0b7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED:

- New rating scale (Slider) handles color properly #1944 and better handling of button drag #1945
- 'newRating' Builder demo has been fixed (forceEndRoutine shouldn't have been happening)
- timeByFrames now renders the graph into the PsychoPy window (was sometimes hanging on mac otherwise)

PsychoPy 3.0.0b6

PsychoPy 3.0.0b2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED: an issue with the app not starting (if git not installed)

PsychoPy 3.0.0b1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PsychoPy3 is the new phase of development including support for online studies
at the Pavlovia.org experiment server. Right now this is BETA SOFTWARE. It WILL
contain bugs but we're fixing them as fast as we/you can find them!

NEW:

- supports heavily revamped PsychoJS library
    - new PsychoJS supports text, images, keboards, mouse and sounds
    - you can also now include Builder Code Components that include both
      Python and JavaScript optional code so your components will work
      online too

- PsychoPy can search, sync and create experiments on Pavlovia.org
    - search for existing studies
    - create your own
    - run (and collect data into csv files)
    - sync, including (push changes to the server and fetch back data)


PsychoPy 1.90
------------------------------

This is a very major refactor of many parts of the PsychoPy code. Treat very
carefully for the first few bug-fix releases as there are likely to be errors
some of which could be catastrophic to your data!!

This is the first attempt at support for Python 3, with maintained support for
Python 2.7. Note that both are available as Standalone packages for Win and Mac.
The Python3.6 version is labelled as Py3 in the download file.

Stick to Python 2.7 if you want your script to break less. If you upgrade to
Python 3 then you'll need to change any print statements to include brackets
and you may also get some new errors springing up about unicode/bytes objects.

PsychoPy 1.90.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released July 2018

FIXED:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released April 2018

ADDED:

* Option to move Y position of `RatingScale` in code #1776
* Added option of providing extra arguments to `scipy.optimize` functions when fitting from `psychopy.data` #1772

FIXED:

PsychoPy 1.90.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released March 2018

ADDED:

* Standalone distributions for Python 3.6 as well as Python 2.7
* Using `pip install psychopy` now installs all the necessary dependencies, making it much easier to install to your own Python installation

PsychoPy 1.85
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.85.6

PsychoPy 1.85.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Sept 2017

There was an error building the 1.85.3 release. Rather than building a bug-fix-inly release, version 1.85.3 has accidentally included some substantial code refactoring intended for the 1.86.0 release.

This version, which we will call 1.85.4 is to replace that 1.85.3 release and provides the same fixes (but not the code refactoring) that was intended in 1.85.3

PsychoPy 1.85.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Aug 2017

This release fixes several bugs but it does also add 2 new dependencies:

* `json_tricks` and `future` are bother required for this version
* these are paving the way for updating Python3 (which will be enabled in 1.86.x series of releases)

FIXED:

    * Problem with text stimuli on Windows not rendering if large (was a bug in pyglet, fixed in 1.3.0b1)
    * Whitespace/indentation guides were not toggling on/off correctly in Coder #4ebbdb9c5468beebb50d817697c0665450e9a5ad

    * nReps and randomisation now being handled correctly by PsychoJS #ad9a931
    * "correct" responses were being overwritten by non-responses #f903210
    * Text components that were static caused a crash (were erroneously given two single-quotes) #b399a50

* Staircase would finish prematurely if nReversals was None #7148cad
* PsychoPy would crash if sound device contained a unicode character #c1ff68f

* textbox v textstim demo wasn't working #b2913c12476
* error with colors when using TextStim with blendmode='add'
* errors in installer package:
    * windows installer could overwrite system path setting
      rather than append (NSIS short-string problem came back!)
    * freetype 32 bit dll is being provided again (was in matplotlib
      before but disappeared?)

PsychoPy 1.85.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Feb 2017

ADDED:
    * `Online experiments now supported <https://www.psychopy.org/online/online.html>`_ using new `PsychoJS library <https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/tree/master/psychojs>`_. See what is supported so far at `PsychoPy online status <https://www.psychopy.org/online/status.html>`_
    * New sound engine using `sounddevice <https://github.com/spatialaudio/python-sounddevice/>`_
    * Checking of image paths for stimuli (did you forget to add ".jpg"?)
    * Copy/paste of a Component is now possible in Builder (right-click the component to copy, use the Experiment menu to paste). This essentially duplicates the component.

FIXED:
    * crash when increasing size of Flow in Builder #1272

    * now packaging 1.2-maintenance branch of pyglet including Text memory fixes

PsychoPy 1.84
------------------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Sept 2016

FIXED:
    * Problem with renaming of Routines preventing experiment from re-loading #1248
    * Several bugs with Builder code generation since PEP8 refactoring:
        * Static Components gave error compiling script
        * some Keyboard Components (with variable "allowed keys" settings) gave error compiling script #1245
        * Mouse Component with "Save state at end of trial" gave indentation error #1253
        * Loops gave error compiling script if conditions file was a formatted string #1253

    * Standalone distributions were not including the correct `pylink 1.1.0.4` and `pyxid` packages

ADDED:
    * Keyfinder demo to Builder view #1252
    * Support for key modifiers using `event.getKeys()` #1242

PsychoPy 1.84.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Sept 2016

FIXED:

ADDED:
    * Movie **outputs** in gif, mp4, mov formats automatically, using moviepy #1228

PsychoPy 1.84.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Aug 2016

ADDED:
    * Projects (new menu) which can sync files with Open Science Framework
    * Movies in Builder can now avoid loading audio (i.e. mute). As well as meaning your movie is genuinely silent this saves processing for the computer, so do it unless you need the sound!
    * menu item to create a .csv (data) file from a .psydat file; see Coder > Tools menu (also: Coder > Demo menu)
    * Builder experiments force a save before the end of the study so pressing the red stop button is less likely to lose data for you
    * You can now **rename a Routine** #1136
    * a Builder experiment setting to specify the version of PsychoPy to be used when running the experiment #1137

CHANGED:

    * MAJOR REFACTOR: A lot of code has been refactored to be more in line with a thing called PEP8. If that doesn't mean anything to you don't worry, it shouldn't affect you. If you like that sort of thing, sorry we didn't got further and get rid of camelCase. ;-)
    * setting ShapeStim vertices dynamically now requires an explicit assignment of the new vertex list to shape.vertices; this can be slow for filled shapes with many vertices. See shapes.py, selfx example.
    * Some file names and locations have changed. To update, replace OLD form in your scripts with NEW form:

      * OLD form --> NEW form
      * Deprecated since 2012, must now update:
        * `from psychopy import calib` --> `from psychopy import monitors as calib` (or just use `monitors`)
        * `from psychopy import bits` --> `from psychopy.hardware.crs import bits`
        * `from psychopy import log` --> `from psychopy import logging`
      * Newly deprecated (the old way still works but logs a warning):
        * `from psychopy import _shadersPyglet` --> `from psychopy.visual import shaders`
        * `from psychopy import gamma` --> `from psychopy.visual import gamma`
        * `from psychopy import filters` --> `from psychopy.visual import filters`
      * API change (only affects people who write their own Builder components):
        * `from psychopy.app.builder.components._visual import VisualComponent` --> `from psychopy.app.builder.components._base import BaseVisualComponent`

    * PyQt is now default over wx for dialog boxes (if either PyQt4 or PyQt5 are installed). Also fixed bug to support PyQt5
    * No Static Components are created by default (e.g. ISI). Have to add them manually

IMPROVED:
    * ShapeStim can properly fill arbitrary shapes (using tessellation); see new shapes.py Coder demo for examples.
    * Coder view now has better support for Retina display on OSX. visual.Window also has a new option to use retina for rendering in the experiment (off by default)
    * better warnings about VLC being wrong architecture for this python install
    * Code Components now indicate which ones actually contain code. #1204

FIXED:
    * bug with Monitor center not creating/saving monitor due to lack of SizePix #1208
    * window viewScale and viewPos combine correctly; viewScale handles negative values, mirror-image flips the window correctly (except for Text)
    * Builder experiments will always add their extension (to stop people overwriting them with the python script of the same experiment)
    * faster writing of multiple lines (bits) to the LabJack
    * sampling rate when using binocular mode in eyelink 1000 #1146
    * Aperture now supports infinite durations in Builder #1122
    * ColorCal II now supports newer pyserial version #1138
    * Erroneous extra data column added if experiment was aborted #1115
    * Ubuntu buglet with importing iohub devices caused by outdated psutils #1172

PsychoPy 1.83
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.83.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Feb 2016

* FIXED:
  * Mac Standalone was (still) not launching on some versions of OSX
  * MovieStim3 not working on all graphics cards (glPopAttrib). Thanks Bryan Cort and Frank Papenmeier for their help
  * MovieStim3 bug with movies that had no audio stream
  * Data saving is forced at the end of Builder Experiments even if script fails to exit properly (red stop button less likely to lose data)
  * Setting gamma on OSX 10.11 wasn't working (Apple moved the lib to a new location). #1089
  * Option to turn off audio in Movies from Builder when not needed (better performance and fewer shutdown-probs)

PsychoPy 1.83.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Dec 2015 (NB 1.83.02 was never publicly released)

* FIXED:
  * problems with the Mac Standalone failing to launch on some OSX versions
  * reduced impact of pyglet text memory leaks (make fewer updates). (NB There is still a leak in Pyglet's code that we can't fix)
  * several fixes to RatingScale
  * window viewScale and viewPos combine correctly; viewScale handles negative values, mirror-image flips the window correctly (except for Text) #1011
  * fixed memory leak in sounds on 64bit Mac installation (error in pyo)
  * MovieStim3 was interacting badly with ShapeStim #981
  * MovieStim3 was failing if no audio stream was present in the file #984
  * PsychoPy app now gives a warning message if it can't start due to permissions error #1055
  * Faster rendering of MovieStim2 and Moviestim3 due to removal of mipmapping code

PsychoPy 1.83.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Oct 2015

* FIXED:
  * new bug with pygame sounds giving fileName not defined
  * several RatingScale bugs; reduce the memory leak (due to pyglet as used in TextStim)
  *
* ADDED: voice-key capability, e.g., for word-naming studies; includes a demo, auxiliary functions (smoothing, zero-crossing, etc), and file-format options (all those supported by pyo)
* CHANGED: remove support for google's speech to text (the new google API is for chrome / chromium developers only)
* CHANGED: deprecate psychopy.web.upload(); use the requests package instead: requests.post()

PsychoPy 1.83.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Oct 2015

* ADDED: MovieStim3 using an alternative backend that doesn’t require avbin, vlc or streamer. It just uses a couple of python libs and FFMPEG, which are relatively easy to package. Seems to have good performance too but this needs more testing
* IMPROVED: speed to load psychopy.visual (“lazy loading” only the stimuli you use are loaded)
* ADDED: RatingScale precision=60 allows display of time-based values (min:sec or hours:min). Values from .getRating() are decimal proportions (1 min: 59 seconds -> 1.9833 minutes).
* ADDED: Coder view can now be set to read-only mode to prevent subjects accidentally altering study #945
* ADDED: TextStim now has property `boundingBox` telling you the maximum area of the letters (defined by the font, not by the actual rendered letters) #35c168f1
* ADDED: Aperture can now be created using images (anything that worked with ImageStim) #923 and can also be inverted so that opaque becomes transparent and vice versa #922 Thanks Thomas Emerling for both
* ADDED: New visual stimulus EnvelopeGrating for contrast-modulated gratings. Thanks Andrew Schofield
* ADDED: option to set mouse_exclusive mode (mouse locked to the window boundary and invisible) Thanks Suddha Sourav #898
* FIXED: DotStim can now change field size on the fly
* FIXED: several (but probably not all) annoying error messages that were unimportant
* FIXED: Condition file in Builder no longer abbreviated. Thanks Mike #913

    - FIXED: unicode issues in user preferences panel #930 #932
    - FIXED: MonitorCenter won't lock you out if given an invalid screen number #937
    - FIXED: mono++ mode in CRS Bits++/#/Display++ is now using full dynamic range (previously 8bit blue gun overlay was overriding the 16bit screen buffer)

PsychoPy 1.82.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Feb 2015


PsychoPy 1.82.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Feb 2015

* FIXED: problem with MovieStim2 showing black box instead of movie on certain systems
* FIXED: problem with Tobii eye tracker not closing calibration window (Sol)
* FIXED: better timing for non-slip routines that follow dynamic routines (Jeremy) #822
* FIXED: problem with stimuli (e.g. shapes) not appearing if a texture had just been created and not yet drawn
* FIXED: pygame sound engine complained about "global variable loops not defined"
* ENHANCED: Filename collision handling for ExperimentHandler (Richard Höchenberger)
* CHANGED: for text data outputs that give delim='\t' the file extension '.tsv' is added instead of '.dlm' (Richard Höchenberger)


PsychoPy 1.82.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Jan 2015

* ENHANCED: slightly faster rendering of movies for high-rate HD stimuli
* CHANGED: `pandas` is now a strict requirement for the `psychopy.data` module
* FIXED: Builder sounds from file no longer loop indefinitely
* FIXED: Builder: microphone recordings are explicitly stopped at the end of every trial

* ADDED: support for PST response box (Richard Höchenberger)
* FIXED: extraInfo was not being saved in wide-text format
* FIXED: Builder was not respecting order for drawing polygon - it was always drawn first
* ADDED: Builder now supports 'degFlat and 'degFlatPos' units and documentation has been added for these

PsychoPy 1.81
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.81.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Dec 2014

* ADDED: Sounds in Builder can now have a duration set by a variable (changing each repeat). The work on this may cause some systems to have a periodic 'tick' in the sound if they last longer than 10s (probably dependent on sound card and driver)
* IMPROVED: RatingScale will always display a custom description ('scale') if provided by the user
* ADDED: Monitor Center can now calibrate non-primary monitors
* FIXED: components in Builder can now be 'stopped' at the same time as they are started and never show up (previously at least one frame was always required)
* FIXED: several issues with Bits++ causing a rendering glitch and not being able to calibrate from Monitor Centre
* FIXED: choice selection boxes stopped working in monitor centre (caused by hardware.crs.bits importing pyglet.gl)
* FIXED: Bits# can be set to do gamma correction in the PsychoPy LUT ('software') rather than using the on-board gamma table file ('hardware')
* FIXED: bug with monitor calib files not returning their linearization method correctly
* ADDED: psychopy.qtgui as alternative to gui which doesn't duffer from problem with choice boxes and pyglet clashing (thanks Sol)
* FIXED: data files now correctly include the originPath (the path to the script that created them). Thanks Alex Holcombe for the fix

PsychoPy 1.81.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Oct 2014

* FIXED: bug with gamma not being set from the Monitor file
* FIXED: MovieStim2 warnings about dropped frames were crippling the output window
* FIXED: new issue (in 1.81.01) with several drop-down menus in Builder not allowing to select that option

PsychoPy 1.81.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Oct 2014

* FIXED: bug with rendering of Movies from Builder (autoDraw() not working)
* ADDED: option to use new movie backend from Builder (there is now an option to select `opencv` or `avbin` for movie rendering)
* FIXED: if MovieStim2 couldn't load frames fast enough it ran slow (should drop frames but stay synchronised). (Sol)
* FIXED: fix spurious warnings about GratingStim.__del__
* FIXED: pyo audio crashed on windows if no mic/input was found (Sogo Hiroyuki)
* ADDED: serial port device in iohub (Sol)

PsychoPy 1.81.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Sept 2014

* IMPROVED: cross-version compatibility:

    * In Builder experiments from 'future' versions can be opened and unknown objects will be ignored (but kept)
    * In Code you can now do `import psychopy; psychopy.useVersion('X.XX.XX')` to switch to any version greater than 1.76.00 (including versions not installed and future versions). This only affects the lib, not the application. (Thanks Erik Kastman for most of the work on this)

* IMPROVED: better unit tests for visual stimuli to prevent future bugs
* CHANGED: MovieStim was right-left flipping movies and this has been corrected. If you had been working around that by setting flipVertical=True then you'll need to undo that correction
* IMPROVED: Can now select a subset of conditions in Builder loops and in `data.importConditions()` function (thanks Mike MacAskill for help)
* IMPROVED: In Builder, loops that don't reflect trials (e.g. stimuli within a trial or blocks of trials) can be flagged as such, resulting in neater data files
* ADDED: support for additional hardware:

    * basic support for interacting with BlackBoxToolkit v2 psychopy.hardware.bbtk
    * CHANGED: added basic support for CRS Bits# in psychopy.hardware.crs. New way to interface with Bits++ as well, using a class rather than a Window argument. See demo in demos>hardware
    * labjack digital outputs can be used as a Parallel Port Component in Builder
    * the screen rendering can now include a warping step to simulate spherical, cylindrical or custom warping (Jay Borseth)
    * the screen now supports 'frame packing' whereby sequential frames can be packed into one, as the red, green and blue channels for monochrome high-rate projectors (Jay Borseth)
    * ioHub eye tracker interface for GazePoint GP3 (Martin Guest)
    * ioHub Serial device:

        * Support for simple fixed width or marker delimited serial rx stream -> device event parsing.
        * Demo created showing usage with PST Response box added (Richard Höchenberger)
    * ioHub ioSync device:

        * Use Teensy 3.0 / 3.1 MCU. Connect via USB 2.0.
        * 8 / 8 digital inputs / outputs
        * 8 analog inputs (~12 - 13 bit effective resolution)
        * 1000 Hz sampling rate for analog and digital inputs.
        * Keyboard Host support (useful for testing keyboard delay variability from software alone)

* IMPROVED packaging:

    * can now install on OSX using miniconda/anaconda distribution (Erik Kastman)
    * pyopencv (cv2) added to Standalone as an alternative to avbin
    * PySoundCard and PySoundFile added to Standalone
    * psutil added to Standalone
    * application is now compatible with wxPython 2.8, 2.9 and 3.0

* ADDED: MovieStim2 stimulus type. Compared to MovieStim, improved performance and wider range of media encoding support has been reported from testing feedback on all OS's.
* IMPROVED: stimulus attributes:

    * Nearly all stimulus attributes now support new syntax, e.g. `stim.pos = [0,0]` as well as the previous `stim.setPos([0,0])`. All docs are update to reflect this change.
    * All numeric stimulus attributes now support operations. Use e.g. `stim.pos += [0,0.5]`. Read more in :ref:`Operations <attrib-operations>`.
    * Many more stimulus attributes can now be set after initialization. They have the same name as the init parameters. E.g. `stim.win = mySecondWindow` changes which Window the stimulus is drawn to

* IMPROVED: logging

    * CHANGED: `log=None` and `autoLog=None` inherits from parents, with `visual.Window` at the top of the hierarchy. None is now default for all stimuli and setter methods.
    * FIXED: removed unnecessary (e.g. duplicate) logging.
    * IMPROVED: unnamed stimuli are now given a default name in the logs for easier identification, e.g. "unnamed ShapeStim".

* IMPROVED: you can now specify the standard deviation (default=3) for gaussian mask in various stimuli by setting e.g. `maskParams={'sd':5}` during init or after init.
* ADDED: language localization (Builder and Coder)

    * Can now display the app menus, tooltips, and so on in a language other than US English (selectable via prefs -> app -> locale)
    * Almost all displayed text can be translated (Jeremy Gray, Hiroyuki Sogo)
    * A Japanese translation is available (Hiroyuki Sogo)
    * Other translations will be easy to add; see online developer notes on using Poedit

* IMPROVED: psychopy.ioHub

    * CHANGED: Keyboard device and events are more user-friendly.
      Note: This release is not backwards compatible with earlier versions of the ioHub Keyboard device or event data file.
      Please see documentation for details.
    * Backend integration between iohub and psychopy continues to improve.
    * ioHub can now be used in OS X 10.9 with PsychoPy Coder. NOTE: Must add Coder app to accessibility list.
    * Several bug fixes.

* FIXED: several other minor bugs (that would have given exceptions if encountered). Thanks particularly to Philip Wiesemann for finding several of these
* FIXED: machines that didn't support shaders or framebuffer objects were raising an error on win.flip() if the useFBO argument was not manually set to False. Machines that don't support the new rendering methods are now handled more gracefully

PsychoPy 1.80
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.80.08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Aug 2014

FIXED: bug with using numpy arrays as masks; they were being interpreted as floats but should have been bytes


PsychoPy 1.80.07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Aug 2014

FIXED: bug with timing of keys when using the `timestamped` argument

PsychoPy 1.80.06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: June 2014

* FIXED: problem with using the framebuffer object (nothing was rendered at all)
* ENH: added support for using a stencil when the framebuffer object is turned on

PsychoPy 1.80.05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: June 2014

* IMPROVED: better unit tests for visual stimuli to prevent further regressions of the issues below
* FIXED: machines that didn't support shaders or framebuffer objects were raising an error on win.flip() if the useFBO argument was not manually set to False. Machines that don't support the new rendering methods are now handled more gracefully.
* FIXED: further fixes to greyscale coloring (some images were not correctly detected as greyscale by PIL so tests weren't working)
* FIXED: machines that didn't support shaders or framebuffer objects were raising an error on win.flip() if the useFBO argument was not manually set to False. Machines that don't support the new rendering methods are now handled more gracefully

PsychoPy 1.80.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: April 2014

* FIXED: buglets in logging. Logging wasn't encoding unicode correctly for console targets (but file targets were OK) and some duplicate messages were occurring for stimulus autologs
* FIXED: buglet with GratingStim/PatchStim when texture was not a square power of two (was crashing due to incorrect global variable)
* FIXED: ElementArrayStim was not updating its position using .setFieldPos()

PsychoPy 1.80.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: April 2014

* FIXED: Shader code was ignoring opacity setting for ImageStim
* FIXED: Mouse clock was not the same as PsychoPy's general events clock (so out of sync) (Sol & Jeremy)

PsychoPy 1.80.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: April 2014

* FIXED: ImageStim did not use its mask on some machines (nVidia and ATI?) or did not render at all on others (intel graphics?)
* CHANGED: Sound object now checks if the sound is a note name before checking for file names (only affects cases where the file name was something like A.wav)
* ADDED: Aperture now supports contains() and overlaps() methods
* ADDED: Image/Grating masks can now also be 'cross' (Suddha Sourav)
* FIXED: Unicode problem for microphone on non-English installs of win32
* FIXED: StairHandler first reversal now changes step size correctly and added option not to use the initial 1-up,1-down regime (Jon maintains that you should though!) (thanks Nathanael Larigaldie)
* FIXED: emulator LaunchScan uses new RatingScale syntax

PsychoPy 1.80.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Mar 2014

* FIXED: buglet with movie glPopAttrib() on Intel gfx cards (thanks Bryan Cort)
* FIXED: problem trying to use FrameBufferObject (FBO) on Intel GMA graphics cards

* FIXED: automated import of gamma for known monitors, which was failing on some monitor calibration files
* FIXED: a single-line conditions file is now imported correctly by Builder (Jeremy Gray)
* IMPROVED: a Routine not included in a loop now saves its data to a default 'loop' (Jeremy Gray)
* IMPROVED: Coder checks for consistency of end-of-line options (thanks Wilbert van Ham)

PsychoPy 1.80.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Mar 2014

* Improvements to user interface:

    * the glitch that prevented scrolling the Routine view is gone (win32)
    * dialog boxes in the Builder now have tabs for categories of controls
    * Code Components have much more space for each piece of code (again due to tabs)

* ADDED: In Builder you can now customise the data filename/path in the Experiment Settings. Any variables in the `expInfo`
  dialog box can be used to create this path. See `dataFileName` for further info
* ADDED: support for advanced rendering modes. Can now 'add' rather than average when using transparency. This is better
  for visual compound stimuli like plaids, and essential for colored anaglyph stimuli where the resulting image needs to
  be the sum of the left and right eye images.
* ADDED: new visual unit options: 'degFlatPos' and 'degFlat' provide more accurate conversions from degrees to pixels for
  drawing stimuli (although they're more accurate, accounting for the flat screen, they may look strange because 1 degree
  gets larger with greater eccentricity on a flat screen). The previous unit 'deg' still exists and remains default as, for
  many studies, these are expected
* ADDED: wider support for the functions `contains` and `overlaps`. Most stimuli now have these methods. Also they can
  now be used irrespective of whether the stimulus and other object have the same units (they used only to work for
  units of pix)
* ADDED: support for other shapes in the Aperture stimulus (and its Builder Component). You can either specify the
  number of vertices `nVert` and a `size` to get a regular polygon aperture, or you can provide a set of arbitrary
  vertices as your `shape` argument
* CHANGED: Size of 'square' or 'triangle' apertures used to represent the radius of the circle on which their vertices
  lay. It is now a height/width as you would more likely expect. This means aperture code in scripts may need rewriting
  to be smaller.
* IMPROVED: stimulus duration is now more precise when using `duration (s)` or `time (s)` although using `nFrames`
  option is still advised for brief stimuli
* IMPROVED: there are now fewer irrelevant lines in the log file as stimuli are initially created
* IMPROVED: Staircase loops in Builder now initialise just before the staircase is run, rather than at the start of the
  experiment. This means they can be controlled by an outer loop and, effectively, restarted
* FIXED: ElementArrayStim can take Nx3 or 1x3 values for colors again
* FIXED: variable names in Builder are now case-sensitive again (they were being forced to lower case when importing csv
  files)
* FIXED: incorrect equation for the Cumulative Normal fitting function
* FIXED: If your variable had a new line character in it this was causing a new line to be started in the csv data file.
  These are now handled correctly

* ADDED: RatingScale markerStart position can be arbitrary, e.g., can start between items or beyond the end of scale
* ADDED: RatingScale tickHeight can be used to control the height of tickMarks, including no tick marks (tickHeight=0)
* ADDED: RatingScale marker='hover' is similar to HTML-style hovering over clickable elements

*psychopy.visual.RatingScale Changes* :

* CHANGED: Builder: remove option: choiceLabelsAboveLine; change lowAnchorText, highAnchorText -> labels
* CHANGED: skipping a rating now adds None as the final element in the history
* CHANGED: the default minTime is shorter, now 0.4s
* CHANGED: more info in the log when creating a rating scale object
* CHANGED: removed showAnchors: now use labels=None (instead of showAnchors=False)
* CHANGED: removed lowAnchorText & highAnchorText: now use labels=['leftAnchor', 'rightAnchor'] or with optional 3rd midpoint label
* CHANGED: renamed several parameters: stretchHoriz -> stretch, textSizeFactor -> textSize, ticksAboveLine -> tickHeight, displaySizeFactor -> size, markerStyle -> marker, customMarker -> marker
* CHANGED: removed showScale: now use scale=None (instead of showScale=False)
* CHANGED: removed allowSkip: now use skipKeys=None (instead of allowSkip=False)
* CHANGED: removed escapeKeys; no longer supported but it's easy to implement (as now done in the coder demo)

PsychoPy 1.79
------------------------------

* FIXED: further fix to the extra "file close" queries during shut-down

PsychoPy 1.79.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Dec 2013

* ADDED: attributes for some stimuli can now be updated using e.g. `stim.pos = newPos` rather than using `stim.setPos(newPos)` to make things more like standard Python (thanks Jonas Lindeløv). This version also involved some major restructuring behind the scenes that should not be visible to users (thanks Todd Jennings)

* ADDED: builder demo for mental rotation task
* ADDED: Alternative Text stimulus, psychopy.visual.TextBox (Sol Simpson)
        * Two demos in psychopy.coder.visual.textbox
        * Requires: freetype lib (included in Standalone)
        * Advantages: Very fast update following text change; very precise character placement.
        * Disadvantages: Supports monospace fonts only.
        * IMPORTANT: TextBox is still being finalized and completed; expect to find (and please report) issues. API changes guaranteed.
* FIXED: misaligned responses in csv output for QuestHandler (Zhili Zheng)
* FIXED: bug when using ElementArrayStim with numpy 1.7.1. Most elements were receiving SF=0
* FIXED: 'semi-automatic' calibration (thanks Flip Phillips)
* FIXED: shut-down issues. Builder now remembers its last experiment and you don't get multiple messages about the scripts that have changed
* FIXED: bugs with MultiStairHandler that were making it unusable (in code and Builder)
* FIXED: lists of key presses can now be considered `correct` (Ian Hussey)
* FIXED: certain further cases of bitmap images appearing desaturated
* FIXED: mono sounds now duplicate to both channels correctly
* changes to Standalone packages (require fetching the installer):
    * pyFileSec for uploading files to server using encryption (this is Jeremy's module)
    * pandas on win32 is now v1.3 (was already this version on OS X)
    * pyxid now includes Jared's upstream bug-fix
* FIXED: many user interface tweaks, documentation and help string corrections (Philip Wiesemann)
* FIXED: PsychoPy Coder view now closes the iohub process when the experiment script is terminated using 'Stop'. (Sol Simpson)
* FIXED: Builder use of single staircase loops now respects the min/max values
* CHANGED: data curve fitting functions are now using scipy.optimise.curve_fit and should hopefully be more robust to local minima(?)

*psychopy.iohub Changes* :

* ADDED: Initial release of the new Touch device:
    * currently supporting Elo brand Touch Screens.
    * any Elo model supporting the SmartSet protocol should work (Elo 2700 model used for testing to date)
    * Touch Events (TouchPress, TouchRelease, TouchMovement) are provided in a separate event stream
    * Touch and Mouse device events are independent of each other, so both devices can be used in parallel without interference
    * Touch screen calibration routine provided; calibration state can be saved to device hardware for persistence
    * See the demos.coder.iohub_extended Touch script for example of calibration graphics front end.
* ADDED: Keyboard and Mouse events can be restricted to those events targeted at a PsychoPy Window. Currently supported on Windows and Linux only.
* NEW: PsychoPy TrialHandler can now be used to feed experiment condition variables to the ioDataStore.
* NEW: Device configuration file can now be specified to the launchHubServer() function when starting the ioHub Process.

            * define an IP's start and end time criteria using experiment message events, or experiment condition variable columns.
            * re-occurring IP's supported.
            * overlapping IP's supported.
        * Define Regions of Interest (ROI),
            * filter Mouse, Eye Tracker, and Touch device events based on screen location.
            * circle, ellipse, rectangle, and general polygon ROI shapes supported. (ROI functionality is dependent on the shapely python package)

* FIXED: gui choice boxes now handle unicode in their options as well as ASCII strings (thanks Anne Peschel)
* FIXED: Scaling bug for SMI eye-tracker in binocular mode (thanks Sol)
* FIXED: Builder Code Components that were showing up in unreadable, single-line boxes
* IMPROVED: All Builder Dialogs now appear close to the top of the screen (so they don't shoot off the bottom in most screens)

PsychoPy 1.78.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: Aug 2013

* ADDED: option to preload during Builder scripts using :ref:`static`, which uses :class:`~psychopy.core.StaticPeriod` class
* ADDED: Polygon Component to Builder for drawing regular polygons (including simple lines)
* ADDED: TrialHander can now fetch previous trials as well as future ones (thanks Mike MacAskill)

* ADDED: microphone component able to play & identify a marker tone (for vocal RT), compute loudness, compression (Jeremy)
* ADDED: sound files: lossless compress / uncompress (requires flac executable installed separately) (Jeremy)
* ADDED: microphone compress() audio recordings; requires flac download (not packaged with PsychoPy)
* ADDED: new preference `flac` = system path for flac, e.g. c:/Program Files (x86)/FLAC/flac.exe (not always needed)
* FIXED: greyscale images were being distorted during display since 1.77.00
* FIXED: reduced number of queries when closing down and provides filenames of changed files in msg (thanks Piot Iwaniuk)

PsychoPy 1.77
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.77.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: July 2013

* FIXED: problem with Builder Images appearing grey unless they were 'constant'. This is a bug that was introduced in 1.77.00 with the faster loading of images.
* FIXED: having a monitors folder with a unicode character in the path doesn't break the app (thanks Sebastiaan Mathot)

PsychoPy 1.77.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: June 2013

* Standalone package changes:
    - pytables downgraded to 2.3.5 on Win32 (to be compatible with WinXP)
    - pyo upgraded to 0.6.6 on OSX and Win32
* FIXED: The recent files list in Builder now contains recent files! (Thanks Piotr Iwaniuk)
* FIXED: Timing issue with LC Tech eye-tracker in iohub

PsychoPy 1.77.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released: June 2013

* ADDED: preview of Sol Simpson's **ioHub** for faster (asynchronous) polling of hardware including mouse, keyboard, eyetrackers and other devices. See iohub demos for example usage. This provides many advantages over previous event polling:
    - asynchronous process allows constant polling (not tied to refresh rates) in a way that won't impact the rendering of your stimuli. It even runs on a separate CPU core if possible.
    - provides up/down/duration for key presses
    - provides unicode character (rather than simply key name for keyboard)
    - provides a unified API for eyetracker classes
    - provides async access to the parallel port
    - provides an alternative data output format (using hdf5) particularly useful for high-output streaming data (e.g. eye-trackers)

* DEPRECATED: opensslwrap will soon be replaced by pyFileSec, a much-improved version of the same package (= file-oriented encryption)
* IMPROVED: substantially (~40%) faster loading of RGB images from disk (by using byte format rather than float). May also allow storing of more images on graphics card than previously
* ADDED: `AdvancedMicrophone` class to add and retrieve a high-frequency tone to indicate the start of recording (e.g., to allow accurate vocal RT estimation), with demo (Jeremy Gray)
* REFACTORED: parallel port support. Support for Windows via inpout32/inpout64 and Linux via pyparallel added.  Existing API maintained for single port usage, but new PParallel classes added to provide more flexibility when dealing with multiple ports. see `parallel` (Thanks Mark Hymers)
* ADDED: `MovieStim` now updates its `status` attribute to FINISHED, in line with other stimuli
* CHANGED: microphone default file names include milliseconds (to avoid two files with the same name)
* ADDED: color-word speech-recognition demo (coder > input > speech_recognition.py)
* ADDED: in Builder components dialog boxes, text that will be interpreted as code is displayed in monospace font
* ADDED: remove and warn about trailing whitespace in Builder component values (but not Text fields)
* ADDED: support for pyglet version 1.2 alpha (but 1.1.4 is still recommended - it appears to render faster)
* ADDED: more sound.SoundPyo methods (get & set duration, volume, looping)
* FIXED: event.Mouse() can obtain a default visual.Window(), if one has already been created
* ADDED: Builder components generate a compile-time warning if a field's value looks dynamic but its updating is constant (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED: better simulated scanner-noise in launchScan (just for fun)
* ADDED: RatingScale.getHistory() returns intermediate time-stamped ratings; allows "continuous" ratings
* CHANGED: RatingScale.getRating() no longer returns False prior to an accepted rating (now returns the currently selected value)

PsychoPy 1.76
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.76.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The compatibility changes in this release below are likely to affect very few users.

* ADDED: Window.callOnFlip() function to allow arbitrary functions to be called, timed precisely to the point where the frame flip has occurred (see Coder Demos>Timing>callOnFlip)
* FIXED: a scaling bug in RatingScale descriptions (Giuseppe Pagnoni)
* ADDED: support for mirror-image text, and mirror-image BufferImageStim (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED: support for lower latency sound with the pyo library. For now pygame remains the default but this can be changed by setting the order in preferences>general>audio
* CHANGED: PsychoPy Standalone is now being built using python 2.7.3 (rather than 2.6). Under OSX psignifit has been removed from this distribution, as have the libraries to create .mov files using Window.saveMovieFrames(). If you need those features then install the 1.75 Standalone and then update to 1.76 using the auto-update system.
* ADDED: sound objects (either pygame or pyo) now support autologging
* FIXED: a bug in the generation of the LMS color space conversion matrix. It seems nobody was actually using this for real, but if you were contact Jon for details!
* CHANGED: various changes to RatingScale (thanks Henrik Singman):
   * CHANGED: choices are now displayed at the tick marks by default (instead of above the line). To restore the old behavior set labels=False. This does not affect experiments created in older versions of the builder.
   * ADDED: check box "choiceLabelsAboveLines" to the RatingScale component of the builder (advanced tab) to still have the choice labels above the line.
   * ADDED: arguments tickMarks and labels to RatingScale class to control where tick marks (for quantitative rating scales) should be placed at the line and how these should be labeled.
   * ADDED: argument ticksAboveLine to RatingScale class. Controls where the tick marks should be plotted (above or below the line).
* FIXED: problem with unset exp.name (was causing wx.Dialog error "TypeError: String or Unicode type required" on new experiments)
* CHANGED: exp.name is no longer available from Builder scripts (can use exp.getExpName() instead)
* FIXED: problem with tiling of depth values for ElementArrayStim (thanks Yuri Spitsyn)
* FIXED: Fix to setContrast for certain visual stimuli (Jonas Lindeløv)
* FIXED: inability to launch scripts/experiments if the Mac Standalone was in a folder with a space in it
* FIXED: Aperture Component now honours the 'units' (Hiroyuki Sogo)
* FIXED: stimulus contains/overlaps functions now use stimulus 'units' and take stimulus orientation into account (Hiroyuki Sogo) NB if you had code in place to perform these corrections yourself you should now remove it!
* FIXED: some data outputs were not honouring the 'matrixOnly' option (Mike MacAskill)
* FIXED: when loading a psydat file of an ExperimentHandler the file automatically saved new copies of its csv/excel outputs. This no longer occurs (if loaded using misc.fromFile)
* ADDED: timestamp option to event.waitKeys() (Jonas Lindeløv)
* ADDED: a first-run wizard to check the system, report as html (somewhat experimental) (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED: a benchmark wizard (Tools menu) to test hardware & software, option to share on psychopy.org (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED: info.getRAM() (Jeremy Gray)

PsychoPy 1.75.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FIXED: Bug with not being able to play sounds of blank (infinite) duration from Builder

PsychoPy 1.75.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* CHANGED: New Builder experiments will, by default, save a single csv file, a single psydat file and a single log file. Was previously also saving an Excel file (with one sheet per loop) and many psydat files (one per loop). Psydat files can still be used to re-output any format of data file.
* IMPROVED: Experiment info dialog box easier to control now from experiment settings (user doesn't need to write a dictionary by hand any more)
* IMPROVED: Components in the Builder are now arranged in categories, including a special 'Favorites' category
* IMPROVED: Code Components now support full syntax highlighting and code folding (but still aren't quite big enough!)
* ADDED: Builder undo/redo now gives info about what is going to be un/redone
* ADDED: Window now supports a `stereo` flag to provide support for quad-buffers (advanced graphics cards only)
* FIXED: bug with copying/pasting Routines that was breaking Flow in certain situations and corrupting the experiment file
* FIXED: fatal typo in QuestHandler code (Gary Lupyan)
* FIXED: data outputs for multiple key/mouse presses
* ADDED: Microphone now supports `stop` to abort recording early (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED: beginning of error reporting when generating Builder experiments (thanks Piotr Iwaniuk)
* FIXED: csv files now generated from Builder as expected not dlm files (tab-delimited)

PsychoPy 1.74
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.74.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* IMPROVED: larger Code Component boxes (and fixed bug with being only one line on linux)
* FIXED: Builder code syntax error when using Mouse set state 'every frame'
* FIXED: Builder was erroneously using 'estimated duration' for constraining non-slip timing
* FIXED: Builder couldn't open Experiment Settings if the expected screen number didn't exist on this system

PsychoPy 1.74.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Aug 2012)

* FIXED: the multiline text entry box in the Builder Text Component was broken (thanks Piotr Iwaniuk)
* IMPROVED: serial (RS232) interface to fORP button box to avoid recording repeated presses (thanks Nate Vack). Does not affect use of fORP box from USB interface.

PsychoPy 1.74.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Aug 2012)

* FIXED: bug leading to message: `IndexError: string index out of range.` This was caused by problem saving excel files
* FIXED: bug leading to message: `AttributeError: ImageStim instance has no attribute 'rgbPedestal'.` Was only occurring on non-shaders machines using the new ImageStim.
* FIXED: problem loading old ExperimentHandlers that contained MultiStairHandlers
* FIXED: Builder Text Components gave an error if letter height was a variable
* ADDED: Window.flip() now returns the timestamp for the flip if possible (thanks Sol Simpson)
* ADDED: misc.sph2cart (Becky Sharman)
* ADDED: warning when user presents SimpleImageStim that seems to extend beyond screen (James McMurray)

PsychoPy 1.74.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: July 2012)

* FIXED: the pyo package is now included in the windows Standalone distribution (making audio input available as intended)
* FIXED: error saving excel data from numpy.int formats (Erik Kastman)
* FIXED: error at end of automated gamma calibration (which was causing a crash of the calibration script)
* FIXED: misc.getDateStr() returns numeric date if there's an error with unicode encoding (Jeremy)
* FIXED: added partial support for non-ASCII keyboards (Sebastiaan Mathot)

PsychoPy 1.74.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy)

Major changes (and compatibility changes):

* ADDED: Long-wide data file outputs, which are now the default for all new Builder experiments.
* ADDED: basic audio capture (and speech recognition via google!). Builder now has a Microphone Component to record inputs, but does not yet use the speech recognition facility. See psychopy.microphone library, coder demo "input/say_rgb.py" and Builder demo "voiceCapture".  (Jeremy)
* ADDED: HSV color space for all stimuli
* CHANGED: in Builder the default dotstim has signal dots='same' (once a signal dot, always a signal dot). Only affects new experiments.

Tweaks and fixes:

* FIXED: missing parameter name in conditions file is detected, triggers more informative error message
* ADDED: fORP: option asKeys to handle button presses as pyglet keyboard events (when using a serial port); faster getUniqueEvents()
* ADDED: basic file encryption (beta) using RSA + AES-256; see API encryption for usage and caveats
* ADDED: upload a file to a remote server over http (libs: web.upload) with coder demo, php scripts for server `contrib/http/*`
* ADDED: Builder demo (dualRatingScales): show a stim, get two different ratings side by side [unpack the demos again]
* ADDED: rating scale options: 'maxTime' to time-out, 'disappear' to hide after a rating; see new Builder demo
* FIXED: rating scale bug: skipKeys was not handling 'tab' properly (no skip for tab-key, do skip for 't', 'a', or 'b')
* ADDED: new locale pref for explicitly setting locale, used in date format and passed to builder scripts (Jeremy, Hiroku Sogo)
* ADDED: 'enable escape' option in experiment settings, default is 'enabled'
* ADDED: support for ElementArrayStim to use the same set of color spaces as other stimuli
* CHANGED: removed python 2.4 version of sha1 digest from :class:`~psychopy.info.RunTimeInfo`
* CHANGED: removed any need for PyOpenGL (pyglet.gl now used throughout even for pygame windows)
* FIXED: Builder was ignoring changes to DotStim FieldPos (thanks Mike MacAskill)
* FIXED: Builder Flow is smarter about Loops and now stops you creating 'broken' ones (e.g. Loops around nothing)
* FIXED: MovieStim used from Builder was not working very well. Sounds continued when it was told to stop and the seek(0.0001) line was causing some file formats not to work from Builder only (those that don't support seeking)
* FIXED: Mouse component was not saving clicks in Builder experiments if forceEndOnClick was set to be False
* FIXED: DotStim.setFieldCoherence was having no effect if noise dots were updating by 'position'

PsychoPy 1.73
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.73.06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PsychoPy 1.73.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Feb 2012)

* CHANGED: Builder scripts now silently convert division from integers to float where necessary. That means 1/3=0.333 whereas previously 1/3=0. This is done simply by adding the line `from __future__ import division` at the top of the script, which people using Coder might want to think about too.
* FIXED: problem with loading .psydat files using misc.fromFile (thanks Becky)
* FIXED: issue on OSX with updating from 1.70 binaries to 1.73 patch release

PsychoPy 1.73.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Jan 2012)

PsychoPy 1.73.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Jan 2012)

* CHANGED: psychopy.log has moved to psychopy.logging (Alex Holcombe's suggestion). You'll now get a deprecation warning for using psychopy.log but it will still work (for the foreseeable future)
* ADDED: new hardware.joystick module supporting pyglet and pyjame backbends for windows and OSX. Demo in Not working on Linux yet. See demos>input
* ADDED: support for CRS ColorCAL mkII for gamma calibrations in Monitor Center.
* ADDED: data.ExpHandler to combine data for multiple separate loops in one study, including output of a single wide csv file. See demos>experimental control>experimentHandler. Support from Builder should now be easy to add
* ADDED: ability to fix (seed) the pseudorandom order of trials in Builder random/full-random loops
* ADDED: auto-update (and usage stats) can now detect proxies in proxy.pac files. Also this now runs in a low-priority background thread to prevent any slowing at startup time.
* FIXED: bug when passing variables to Staircase loops in Builder
* FIXED: mouse in Builder now ignores button presses that began before the 'start' of the mouse
* FIXED: can now use pygame or pyaudio instead of pygame for sounds, although it still isn't recommended (thanks Ariel Rokem for patch)

PsychoPy 1.72.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(rc1 Released: Nov 2011)

* CHANGED: gui.Dlg and gui.dlgFromDict can now take a set of choices and will convert to a choice control if this is used (thanks Manuel Ebert)
    - for gui.Dlg the `.addField()` method now has `choices` attribute
    - for gui.dlgFromDict if one of the values in the dict is a list it will be interpreted as a set of choices (NB this potentially breaks old code)
    - for info see API docs for psychopy.gui

* ADDED: improvements to drawing of shapes (thanks Manuel Ebert for all)
    - ShapeStim now has a size parameter that scales the locations of vertices
    - new classes; Rect, Line, Circle, Polygon

* FIXED: error with DotStim when fieldSize was a tuple and fieldShape was 'sqr'
* FIXED: calibration plots in Monitor Center now resize and quit as expected
* FIXED: conditions files can now have lists of numbers [0,0]
* FIXED: buglet with flushing mouse events (thanks Sebastiaan Mathot)
* FIXED: Builder components now draw in order, from top to bottom, so lower items obscure higher ones
* FIXED: problem with Patch Component when size was set to be dynamic
* FIXED: problem with Builder loops not being able to change type (e.g. change 'random' into 'staircase')
* FIXED: data from TrialHandler can be output with unicode contents (thanks Henrik Singmann)

PsychoPy 1.71
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.71.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Oct 2011)

* CHANGED: the number of stimulus-resized and frames-dropped warnings is now limited to 5 (could become a preference setting?)
* FIXED: Builder now allows images to have size of None (or 'none' or just blank) and reverts to using the native size of the image in the file
* FIXED: occasional glitch with rendering caused by recent removal of depth testing (it was getting turned back on by TextStim.draw())
* FIXED: opening a builder file from coder window (and vice versa) switches view and opens there
* FIXED: problem showing the About... item on OS X Builder view
* FIXED problem with loops not showing up if the conditions file wasn't found
* FIXED: runTimeInfo: better handling of cwd and git-related info
* FIXED: rating scale: single click with multiple rating scales, auto-scale with precision = 1
* IMPROVED: rendering speed on slightly older nVidia cards (e.g. GeForce 6000/7000 series) under win32/linux. ElementArrays now render at full speed. Other cards/systems should be unchanged.
* IMPROVED: rating scale: better handling of default description, scale=None more intuitive
* ADDED: new function getFutureTrial(n=1) to TrialHandler, allowing users to find out what a trial will be without actually going to that trial
* ADDED: misc.createXYs() to help creating a regular grid of xy values for ElementArrayStim

PsychoPy 1.71.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Sept 2011)

* CHANGED: Depth testing is now disabled. It was already being recommended that depth was controlled purely by drawing order (not depth settings) but this is now the *only* way to do that
* CHANGED: The Builder representation of the Components onset/offset is now based on 'estimatedStart/Stop' where a value has been given. NB this does not affect the actual onset/offset of Components merely its representation on the timeline.
* ADDED: Builder loop conditions mini-editor: (right-click in the filename box in a loop dialog)
    - create, edit, and save conditions from within PsychoPy; save & load using pickle format
    - preview .csv or .xlsx conditions files (read-only)
* ADDED: RatingScale method to allow user to setMarkerPosition()
* ADDED: Builder dialogs display a '$' to indicate fields that expect code/numeric input
* ADDED: Text Component now has a wrapWidth parameter to control the bounding box of the text
* ADDED: Opacity parameter to visual stimulus components in the Builder, so you can now draw plaids etc from the builder
* FIXED: can edit or delete filename from loop dialog
* FIXED: bug in RunTimeInfo (no longer assumes that the user has git installed)
* FIXED: bug in BufferImageStim
* FIXED: bug in Builder Ratingscale (was always ending routine on response)
* FIXED: problem with nested loops in Builder. Inner loop was not being repeated. Loops are now only created as they are needed in the code, not at the beginning of the script
* FIXED: rendering of many stimuli was not working beyond 1000 elements (fixed by removal of depth testing)
* FIXED: mouse component now using start/duration correctly (broken since 1.70.00)
* FIXED: when changing the texture (image) of a PatchStim, the stimulus now 'remembers' if it had been created with no size/sf set and updates these for the new image (previously the size/sf got set according to the first texture provided)
* FIXED: putting a number into Builder Sound Component does now produce a sound of that frequency
* FIXED: added 'sound','misc','log' to the component names that PsychoPy will refuse. Also a slightly more informative warning when the name is already taken
* FIXED: Opacity parameter was having no effect on TextStim when using shaders
* FIXED bug with MovieStim not starting at beginning of movie unless a new movie was added each routine


PsychoPy 1.70
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.70.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Aug 2011)

* FIXED: buglet with Builder (1.70.00) importing older files not quite right and corrupting the 'allowedKeys' of keyboard component
* FIXED: buglet with SimpleImageStim. On machines with no shaders some images were being presented strangely
* FIXED: buglet with PatchStim. After a call to setSize, SF was scaling with the stimulus (for unit types where that shouldn't happen)

PsychoPy 1.70.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: Aug 2011)

*NB This version introduces a number of changes to Builder experiment files that will prevent files from this version being opened by earlier versions of PsychoPy*

* CHANGED use of allowedKeys in Keyboard Component. You used to be able to type `ynq` to get those keys, but this was confusing when you then needed `'space'` or `'left'` etc. Now you must type 'y','n','q', which makes it more obvious how to include 'space','left','right'...
* CHANGED dot algorithm in DotStim. Previously the signalDots=same/different was using the opposite to Scase et al's terminology, now they match. Also the default method for noiseDots was 'position' and this has been changed to 'direction'. The documentation explaining the algorithms has been clarified. (see :ref:`dots`)
* CHANGED `MovieStim.playing` property to be called `MovieStim.status` (in keeping with other stimuli)
* CHANGED names:

    - `data.importTrialTypes` is now `data.importConditions`
    - `forceEndTrial` in Keyboard Component is now `forceEndRoutine`
    - `forceEndTrialOnPress` in Mouse Component is now `forceEndRoutineOnPress`
    - `trialList` and `trialListFile` in Builder are now `conditions` and `conditionsFile`, respectively
    - 'window units' to set Component units is now 'from exp settings' for less confusion

* CHANGED numpy imports in Builder scripts:

    - only a subset of numpy features are now imported by default: numpy: sin, cos, tan, log, log10, pi, average, sqrt, std, deg2rad, rad2deg, linspace, asarray, random, randint, normal, shuffle
    - all items in the numpy namespace are available as np.*
    - if a pre-v1.70 script breaks due to this change, try prepending 'np.' or 'np.random.'

* CHANGED Builder use of $. $ can now appear anywhere in the field (previously only the start). To display a `$` character now requires `\$` in a text field (to prevent interpretation of normal text as being code).

* ADDED flexibility for start/stop in Builder Components. Can now specify stimuli according to;

    - variable values (using $ symbol). You can also specify an 'expected' time/duration so that something is still drawn on the timeline
    - number of frames, rather than time (s), for greater precision
    - an arbitrary condition (e.g. otherStim.status==STOPPED )

* ADDED the option to use a raised cosine as a PatchStim mask (thanks Ariel Rokem)
* ADDED a preference setting for adding custom path locations to Standalone PsychoPy
* ADDED Dots Component to Builder interface for random dot kinematograms
* ADDED wide-format data files (saveAsWideText()) (thanks Michael MacAskill)
* ADDED option for full randomization of repeated lists (loop type 'fullRandom') (Jeremy)
* ADDED builder icons can now be small or large (in prefs)
* ADDED checking of conditions files for parameter name conflicts (thanks Jeremy)
* ADDED emulate sync pulses and user key presses for fMRI or other scanners (for testing); see hardware/launchScan in the API reference, and Coder `demos > experimental control > fMRI_launchScan.py` (Jeremy)
* ADDED right-clicking the expInfo in Experiment Settings tests & previews the dialog box (Jeremy)
* ADDED syntax checking in code component dialog, right-click (Jeremy)
* IMPROVED documentation (thanks Becky Sharman)
* IMPROVED syntax for using $ in code snippets (e.g., "[$xPos, $yPos]" works) (Jeremy)
* IMPROVED Flow and Routine displays in the Builder, with zooming; see the View menu for key-board shortcuts (Jeremy)
* IMPROVED Neater (and slightly faster) changing of Builder Routines on file open/close
* FIXED demos now unpack to an empty folder (Jeremy)
* FIXED deleting an empty loop from the flow now works (Jeremy)
* FIXED further issue in QUEST (the addition in 1.65.01 was being used too widely)
* FIXED bug with updating of gamma grid values in Monitor Center

PsychoPy 1.65
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.65.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: July 2011)

* FIXED Builder keyboard component was storing 'all keys' on request but not all RTs
* FIXED Aperture Component in Builder, which was on for an entire Routine. Now supports start/stop times like other components
* IMPROVED Sound stimuli in Builder:

    * FIXED: sounds could be distorted and would repeat if duration was longer than file
    * ADDED volume parameter to sound stimuli
    * FIXED: duration parameter now stops a file half-way through if needed

* FIXED buglet preventing some warning messages being printed to screen in Builder experiments
* FIXED bug in the copying/pasting of Builder Routines, which was previously introducing errors of the script with invalid _continueName values

PsychoPy 1.65.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released: July 2011)

* ADDED improved gamma correction using L=a+(b+kI)**G formula (in addition to industry-standard form). Existing gamma calibrations will continue to use old equation but new calibrations will take the new extended formula by default.
* ADDED MultiStairHandler to run multiple interleaved staircases (also from the Builder)
* ADDED createFactorialTrialList, a convenience function for full factorial conditions (thanks Marco Bertamini)
* CHANGED Builder keyboard components now have the option to discard previous keys (on by default)
* CHANGED RatingScale:

  - ADDED: argument to set lineColor independently (thanks Jeff Bye)
  - CHANGED default marker is triangle (affects windows only)
  - ADDED single-click option, custom-marker support
  - FIXED: bug with precision=1 plus auto-rescaling going in steps of 10 (not 1)

* FIXED errors with importing from 'ext' and 'contrib'
* FIXED error in joystick demos
* FIXED bug in ElementArrayStim depth
* FIXED bug in misc.maskMatrix. Was not using correct scale (0:1) for the mask stage
* FIXED buglet in StairHandler, which was only terminating during a reversal
* FIXED bug when loading movies - they should implicitly pause until first draw() (thanks Giovanni Ottoboni)
* IMPROVED handling of non-responses in Builder experiments, and this can now be the correct answer too (corrAns=None). ie. can now do go/no-go experiments. (Non-responses are now empty cells in excel file, not "--" as before.)

PsychoPy 1.64
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.64.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: April 2011

* ADDED option to return field names when importing a trial list (thanks Gary Lupyan)

    - FIXED bug in RatingScale that prevented scale starting at zero
    - ADDED RatingScale "choices" (non-numeric); text size, color, font, & anchor labels; pos=(x,y) (Jeremy Gray)
    - CHANGED RatingScale internals; renamed escapeKeys as skipKeys; subject now uses 'tab' to skip (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED user-configurable code/output font (see coder prefs to change)
* ADDED gui.Dlg now automatically uses checkboxes for bools in inputs (Yuri Spitsyn)
* ADDED RatingScale component for Builder (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED packages to Standalone distros:
    - pyxid (Cedrus button boxes)
    - labjack (good, fast, cheap USB I/O device)
    - egi (pynetstation)
    - pylink (SR Research eye trackers)
    - psignifit (bootstrapping, but only added on mac for now)

PsychoPy 1.63
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.63.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FIXED bug in windows prefs that prevents v1.63.03 from starting up
* FIXED bug that prevents minolte LS100 from being found

PsychoPy 1.63.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Feb 2011

* ADDED Interactive shell to the bottom panel of the Coder view. Choose (in prefs) one of;
    * pyShell (the default, with great tooltips and help)
    * IPython (for people that like it, but beware it crashes if you create a psychopy.visual.Window() due to some threading issue(?))
* ADDED scrollbar to output panel
* FIXED small bug in QUEST which gave an incorrectly-scaled value for the next() trial
* FIXED ElementArrayStim was not drawing correctly to second window in multi-display setups
* FIXED negative sound durations coming from Builder, where sound was starting later than t=0
* FIXED a problem where Builder experiments failed to run if 'participant' wasn't in the experiment info dialog

PsychoPy 1.63.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Feb 2011

* ADDED clearFrames option to Window.saveMovieFrames
* ADDED support for Spectrascan PR655/PR670
* ADDED 'height' as a type of unit for visual stimuli
    NB. this is likely to become the default unit for new users (set in prefs)
    but for existing users the unit set in their prefs will remain. That means
    that your system may behave differently to your (new user) colleague's
* IMPROVED handling of damaged experiments in Builder (they don't crash the app any more!)
* IMPROVED performance of autoLogging (including demos showing how to turn of autoLog for dynamic stimuli)

PsychoPy 1.63.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Jan 2011

* FIXED bug with ElementArrayStim.setFieldPos() not updating
* FIXED mouse release problem with pyglet (since in 1.63.00)
* ADDED ability to retrieve a timestamp for a mouse event, similar to those in keyboard events.
    This is possible even though you may not retrieve the mouse event until later (e.g. waiting
    for a frame flip). Thanks Dave Britton
* FIXED bug with filters.makeGrating: gratType='sqr' was not using ori and phase
* FIXED bug with fetching version info for autoupdate (was sometimes causing a crash on startup
    if users selected 'skip this version')
* CHANGED optimisation routine from fmin_powell to fmin_bfgs. It seems more robust to starting params.

PsychoPy 1.63.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Dec 2010

* **ADDED autoLog mechanism:**
    * many more messages sent, but only written when log.flush() is called
    * rewritten backend to logging functions to remove file-writing performance hit
    * added `autoLog` and `name` attributes to visual stimuli
    * added setAutoDraw() method to visual stimuli (draws on every win.flip() until set to False)
    * added logNextFlip() method to visual.Window to send a log message time-stamped to flip
* **FIXED bug in color calibration for LMS color space (anyone using this space should recalibrate immediately)** Thanks Christian Garber for picking up on this one.
* FIXED bug with excel output from StairHandler
* FIXED bug in ElemetArray.setSizes()
* FIXED bug in running QuestHandler (Zarrar Shehzad)

    * numpy=1.5.1, scipy=0.8.0, matplotlib=1.0
* UPDATED: Builder demos

PsychoPy 1.62
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.62.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Oct 2010

* FIXED: problem with RadialStim causing subsequent TextStims not to be visible
* FIXED: bug with saving StairHandler data as .xlsx
* ADDED: option for gui.fileOpenDlg and fileSaveDlg to receive a custom file filter
* FIXED: builder implementation of staircases (initialisation was buggy)
* FIXED: added Sound.setSound() so that sounds in builder can take new values each trial
* FIXED: when a Routine was copied and pasted it didn't update its name properly (e.g. when inserted into the Flow it kept the origin name)
* FIXED: color rendering for stimuli on non-shader machines using dkl,lms, and named color spaces
* ADDED: data.QuestHandler (Thanks to Zarrar Shehzad). This is much like StairHandler but uses the QUEST routine of Watson and Pelli
* CHANGED: TextStim orientation now goes the other way, for consistency with other stimuli (thanks Manuel Spitschan for noticing)**
* FIXED: Problem with DotStim using 'sqr' fieldShape
* ADDED: MovieStim now has a setMovie() method (a copy of loadMovie())
* FIXED: problem with MovieStim.loadMovie() when a movie had already been loaded

PsychoPy 1.62.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Sept 2010

* ADDED: clicking on a Routine in the Flow window brings that Routine to current focus above
* ADDED: by setting a loop in the Flow to have 0 repeats, that part of your experiment can be skipped
* CHANGED: builder hides mouse now during fullscreen experiments (should make this a pref or setting though?)
* FIXED: rendering problem with the Flow and Routine panels not updating on some platforms
* ADDED: added .pause() .play() and .seek() to MovieStim (calling .draw() while paused will draw current static frame)
* FIXED: bug in MovieStim.setOpacity() (Ariel Rokem)
* FIXED: bug in win32 - shortcuts were created in user-specific start menu not all-users start menu
* CHANGED: data output now uses std with N-1 normalisation rather than (scipy default) N
* FIXED: bug when .psyexp files were dropped on Builder frame
* FIXED: bug with Builder only storing last letter or multi-key button (e.g. 'left'->'t') under certain conditions
* FIXED: when nReps=0 in Builder the loop should be skipped (was raising error)
* CHANGED: mouse icon is now hidden for full-screen Builder experiments
* FIXED: Builder was forgetting the TrialList file if you edited something else in the loop dialog
* ADDED: visual.RatingScale and a demo to show how to use it (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED: The Standalone distributions now includes the following external libs:
    - pynetstation (import psychopy.hardware.egi)
    - ioLab library (import psychopy.hardware.ioLab)
* ADDED: trial loops in builder can now be aborted by setting someLoopName.finished=True
* ADDED: improved timing. *Support for blocking on VBL for all platforms* (may still not work on intel integrated chips)
* FIXED: minor bug with closing Coder windows generating spurious error messages
* ADDED: 'allowed' parameter to gui.fileOpeNDlg and fileCloseDlg to provide custom file filters

PsychoPy 1.62.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: August 2010

* ADDED: support for Excel 2007 files (.xlsx) for data output and trial types input:
    - psychopy.data now has importTrialList(fileName) to generate a trial list (suitable for TrialHandler) from .xlsx or .csv files
    - Builder loops now accept either an xlsx or csv file for the TrialList
    - TrialHandler and StairHandler now have saveToExcel(filename, sheetName='rawData', appendFile=True). This can be used to generate almost identical files to the previous delimited files, but also allows multiple (named) worksheets in a single file. So you could have one file for a participant and then one sheet for each session or run.
* CHANGED: for builder experiments the trial list for a loop is now imported from the file on every run, rather than just when the file is initially chosen
* CHANGED: data for TrialHandler are now stored as masked arrays where possible. This means that trials with no response can be more easily ignored by analysis
* FIXED: bug opening loop properties (bug introduced by new advanced params option)
* FIXED: bug in Builder code generation for keyboard (only when using forceEnd=True but store='nothing')
* CHANGED: RunTimeInfo is now in psychopy.info not psychopy.data
* CHANGED: PatchStim for image files now defaults to showing the image at native size in pixels (making SimpleImageStim is less useful?)
* CHANGED: access to the parameters of TrialList in the Builder now (by default) uses a more cluttered namespace for variables. e.g. if your TrialList file has heading rgb, then your components can access that with '$rgb' rather than '$thisTrial.rgb'. This behaviour can be turned off with the new Builder preference 'allowClutteredNamespace'.
* FIXED: if Builder needs to output info but user had closed the output window, it is now reopened
* FIXED: Builder remembers its window location
* CHANGED: Builder demos now need to be fetched by the user - menu item opens a browser (this is slightly more effort, but means the demos aren't stored within the app which is good)
* CHANGED: loops/routines now get inserted to Flow by clicking the mouse where you want them :-)
* ADDED: you can now have multiple Builder windows open with different experiments
* ADDED: you can now copy and paste Routines form one Builder window to another (or itself) - useful for reusing 'template' routines
* FIXED: color of window was incorrectly scaled for 'named' and 'rgb256' color spaces
* ADDED: quicktime movie output for OSX 10.6 (10.5 support was already working)
* ADDED: Mac app can now receive dropped files on the coder and builder panels (but won't check if these are sensible!!)
* ADDED: debugMode preference for the app (for development purposes)
* ADDED: working version of RatingStim

PsychoPy 1.61
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.61.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Patch Released: May 2010

* FIXED: Bug in coder spitting out lots of errors about no method BeginTextColor

* FIXED: broken link for >Help>Api (reference) menuitem

PsychoPy 1.61.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: May 2010

* CHANGED: color handling substantially. Now supply color and colorSpace arguments and use setColor rather than setRGB etc. Previous methods still work but give deprecation warning.
* ADDED: Colors can now also be specified by name (one of the X11 or web colors, e.g. 'DarkSalmon') or hex color spec (e.g. '#E9967A')
* REMOVED: TextStimGLUT (assuming nobody uses GLUT backend anymore)

* AMERICANIZATION: now consistently using 'color' not 'colour' throughout the project! ;-)
* FIXED: problem with non-numeric characters being inserted into data structures
* CHANGED: stimuli using textures now automatically clean these up, so no need for users to call .clearTextures()

PsychoPy 1.60.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Feb 2010

* CHANGED builder handling of keyboard 'allowedKeys' parameter. Instead of `['1','2','q']` you can now simply use `12q` to indicate those three keys. If you want a key like `'right'` and `'left'` you now have to use `$['right','left']`
* TWITTER follow on https://twitter.com/psychopy
* FIXED? win32 version now compatible with Vista/7? Still compatible with XP?

PsychoPy 1.60.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: Feb 2010

* FIXED: one bug preventing PsychoPy from running on vista/win7 (are there more?)
* CHANGED: psychopy.filters.makeMask() now returns a mask with values -1:1, not 0:1 (as expected by stimulus masks)
* RESTRUCTURED: the serial package is no longer a part of core psychopy and is no longer required (except when hardware is actually being connected). This should now be installed as a dependency by users, but is still included with the Standalone packages.
* RESTRUCTURED: preparing for further devices to be added, hardware is now a folder with files for each manufacturer. Now use e.g.::

    from psychopy.hardware.PR import PR650
    from psychopy.hardware.cedrus import RB730

PsychoPy 1.51.00
------------------------------

NB. The changes to gamma handling should need no changes to your code, but could alter the gamma correction on
some machines. For setups/studies that require good gamma correction it is recommended that you recalibrate when
you install this version of PsychoPy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PsychoPy 0.97:
------------------------------

PsychoPy 0.97.01:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED bug with IDE not closing properly (when current file was not right-most)
* ADDED parallel.readPin(pinN) so that parallel port can be used for input as well as output
* FIXED bug in parallel.setPortAddress(addr)
* ADDED check for floats as arguments to ElementArrayStim set___ methods
* CHANGED: frame time recording to be *off* by default (for plotting, for Window.fps() and for warnings). To turn it on use Window.setRecordFrameIntervals(True), preferably after first few frames have elapsed
* IMPROVED detection of the (truly) dropped frames using log.console.setLevel(log.WARNING)
* FIXED bug that was preventing bits++ from detecting LUT on the Mac (ensure screen gamma is 1.0 first)

* ADDED fieldDepth and depths (for elements, relative to fieldDepth) as separate arguments to the ElementArrayStim

PsychoP 0.97.00:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED options to DotStim motions. Two args have been added:
  * signalDots can be 'different' from or 'same' as the noise dots (from frame to frame)
  * noiseDots determines the update rule for the distractor dots (random 'position', 'walk', 'direction')
  * dotLife now works (was previously just a placeholder). Default is -1 (so should be same as before)
  see Scase, Braddick & Raymond (1996) for further info on the importance of these
* ADDED options to event.getKeys
  * keyList to limit which keys are checked for (thanks Gary Strangman)
  * timeStamped=False/True/Clock (thanks Dave Britton)
* CHANGED pyglet key checking now returns '1' as the key irrespective of numpad or otherwise (used to return '1' or 'NUM_1')
* FIXED bug in event.py for machines where pyglet is failing to import
* REMOVED AlphaStim (after a long period of 'deprecated')

----------

PsychoPy 0.96:
------------------------------

PsychoPy 0.96.02:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED bug introduced with clipping of text in 0.96.01 using textstimuli with shaders  under pygame
* FIXED bug with rendering png alpha layer using pyglet shaders

PsychoPy 0.96.01:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED problem with write errors running demos from Mac IDE
* ADDED frameWidth to textStim for multiline
* ADDED setRecordFrameIntervals, saveFrameTimes() to Window and misc.plotFrameIntervals()
* FIXED had accidentally made pygame a full dependency in visual.py
* FIXED MovieStim was being affected by texture color of other stimuli
* FIXED window now explicitly checks for GL_ARB_texture_float before using shaders

PsychoPy 0.96.00:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED pygame back-end so that can be used as a valid alternative to pyglet (requires pygame1.8+ and PyOpenGL3.0+, both included in mac app)
* CHANGED default sound handler to be pygame again. Although pyglet looked promising for this
  it has turned out to be buggy. Timing of sounds can be very irregular and sometimes they don't even play
  Although pygame has longer overall latencies (20-30ms) it's behaviour is at least robust. This will be
  revisited one day when i have time to write driver-specific code for sounds
* FIXED image importing - scaling from square image wasn't working and CMYK images weren't imported
  properly. Both are now fine.

----------


PsychoPy 0.95:
------------------------------

PsychoPy 0.95.11:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED sound.Sound.getDuration() method

* IDE SaveAs no longer raises (inconsequential) error
* IDE Cmd-S or Ctrl-S now clears autocomplete

PsychoPy 0.95.7:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED misc.cart2pol()
* ADDED highly optimised ElementArrayStim, suitable for drawing large numbers of elements. Requires fast OpenGL 2.0 gfx card - at least an nVidia 8000 series or ATI HD 2600 are recommended.
* FIXED bug in calibTools with MonitorFolder (should have been monitorFolder)
* FIXED bug in Sound.stop() for pyglet contexts
* FIXED bug in running scripts with spaces in the filename/path (Mac OS X)

PsychoPy 0.95.6:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* DISABLED the setting of gamma if this is [1,1,1] (allows the user to set it from a control panel and not have this adjusted)
* FIXED gamma setting on linux (thanks to Luca Citi for testing)
* FIXED bug in TextStim.setRGB (wasn't setting properly after text had been created)
* FIXED bug searching for shaders on ATI graphics cards

    * ~/.PsychoPy/IDE (OS X, linux)
    * <Docs and Settings>/<user>/Application Data/PsychoPy
* FIXED bug in text rendering (ATI/win32/pyglet combo only)

* CHANGED input range for numpy array textures to -1:1
* ADDED sysInfo.py to demos

PsychoPy 0.95.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED quitting PsychoPyIDE now correctly cancels when saving files

PsychoPy 0.95.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED problem with saving files from the IDE on Mac
* FIXED Cmd-C now copies from the output window of IDE
* even nicer IDE icons (thanks to the Crystal project at everaldo.com)

Older
----------------------

PsychoPy 0.94.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* pyglet:
  * can use multiple windows and multiple screens (see screensAndWindows demo)
  * sounds are buffered faster and more precisely (16ms with <0.1ms variability on my system)
  * creating sounds in pyglet starts a separate thread. If you use sounds in your script you must call core.quit() when you're done to exit the system (or this background thread will continue).
  * pyglet window.setGamma and setGammaRamp working on win and mac (NOT LINUX)
  * pyglet event.Mouse complete (and supports wheel as well as buttons)
  * pyglet is now the default context. pygame will be used if explicitly called or if pyglet (v1.1+) isn't found
  * pyglet can now get/save movie frames (like pygame)
  * TextStims are much cleaner (and a bit bigger?) Can use multiple lines too. New method for specifying font
* added simpler parallel.py (wraps _parallel which will remain for now)
* removed the C code extensions in favour of ctypes (so compiler no longer necessary)
* converted "is" for "==" where appropriate (thanks Luca)
* Window.getMovieFrame now takes a buffer argument ('front' or 'back')
* monitor calibration files now stored in HOME/.psychopy/monitors rather than site-packages
* Window.flip() added and supports the option not to clear previous buffer (for incremental drawing). Window.update() is still available for now but can be replaced with flip() commands
* updated demos

PsychoPy 0.93.6:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* bug fixes for OS X 10.5 and ctypes OpenGL
* new improved OS X installer for dependencies
* moved to egg for OS X distribution

PsychoPy 0.93.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added rich text ctrl to IDE output, including links to lines of errors
* IDE now only opens one copy of a given text file
* improved (chances of) sync-to-vertical blank on windows without adjusting driver settings (on windows it's still better to set driver to force sync to be safe!)
* added center and radius arguments to filters.makeMask and filters.makeRadialMatrix
* implemented pyglet backend for;
    * better screen handling (can specify which screen a window should appear in)
    * fewer dependencies (takes care of pygame and opengl)
    * faster sound production
    * TextStims can be multi-line
    * NO GAMMA-SETTING as yet. Don't use this backend if you need a gamma-corrected window and aren't using Bits++.
* changed the behaviour of Window winTypes
    If you leave winType as None PsychoPy tries to use Pygame, Pyglet, GLUT in that order
    (when Pyglet can handle gamma funcs it will become default). Can be overridden by specifying winType.
* turned off depth testing for drawing of text (will simply be overlaid in the order called)
* changes to TextStim: pyglet fonts are loaded by name only, not filename. PsychoPy TextStim now has an additional argument called 'fontFiles=[]' to allow the adding of custom ttf fonts, but the font name should be used as the font=" " argument.
* updated some of the Reference docs

PsychoPy 0.93.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed problem with 'dynamic loading of multitextureARB' (only found on certain graphics cards)

PsychoPy 0.93.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* improved detection of non-OpenGL2.0 drivers

PsychoPy 0.93.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* now automatically uses shaders only if available (older machines can use this version but will not benefit from the speed up)
* slight speed improvement for TextStim rendering (on all machines)

PsychoPy 0.93.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* new requirement of PyOpenGL3.0+ (and a graphics card with OpenGL2.0 drivers?)
* much faster implementation of setRGB, setContrast and setOpacity (using fragment shaders)
* images (and other textures) need not be square. They will be automatically resampled if they are not. Square power-of-two image textures are still recommended
* Fixed problem in calibTools.DACrange caused by change in numpy rounding behaviour. (symptom was strange choice of lum values for calibrations)
* numpy arrays as textures currently need to be NxM intensity arrays
* multitexturing now handled by OpenGL2.0 rather than ARB
* added support for Cedrus response pad
* if any component of rgb*contrast>1 then the stimulus will be drawn as low contrast and b/y (rgb=[0.2,0.2,-0.2]) in an attempt to alert the user that this is out of range

PsychoPy 0.92.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed issue with stairhandler (it was terminating based only on the nTrials). It does now terminate when both the nTrials and the nReversals [or length(stepSizes) if this is greater] are exceeded.
* Minor enhancements to IDE (added explicit handlers to menus for Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-Y, Ctrl-D)

PsychoPy 0.92.4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed some source packaging problems for linux (removed trademark symbols from serialposix.py and fixed directory capitalisation of IDE/Resources in setup.py). Thanks to Jason Locklin and Samuele Carcagno for picking them up.
* numerous minor improvements to the IDE
* reduced the buffer size of sound stream to reduce latency of sound play
* fixed error installing start menu links (win32)

PsychoPy 0.92.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* new source .zip package (switched away from the use of setuptools - it didn't include files properly in a source dist)
* Fixed problem on very fast computers that meant error messages weren't always displayed in the IDE

PsychoPy 0.92.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* have been trying (and failing) to make scripts run faster from the IDE under Mac OS X. Have tried using threads and debug modules (which would mean you didn't need to import all the libs every time). All these work fine under win32 but not under OS X every time :-( If anyone has a new idea for how to run a pygame window in the same process as the IDE thread I'd love hear it
* removed the messages from the new TextStim stimuli
* fixed bug in IDE that caused it to crash before starting if pythonw.exe was run rather than python.exe on first run(!)
* improvements to the source assistant window (better help and now fetches function arguments)

Known Problems:
* The IDE isn't collecting all errors that are returned - a problem with the process redirection mechanism? FIXED in 0.92.3

PsychoPy 0.92.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed minor bug in IDE - wouldn't open if it had been closed with no open docs.
* fixed problem with pushing/popping matrix that caused the stimuli to disappear (only if a TextStim was rendered repeatedly)

PsychoPy 0.92.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 'sequential' ordering now implemented for data.TrialHandler (thx Ben Webb)
* moved to pygame fonts (with unicode support and any TT font on the system). The switch will break any code that was using TextStim with lineWidth or letterWidth as args. Users wanting to continue using the previous TextStim can call textStimGLUT instead (although I think the new pygame fonts are superior in every way).
* improved IDE handling of previous size (to cope with being closed in the maximised or minimised state, which previously caused the window not to return)

PsychoPy 0.91.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed minor bug in using numpy.array as a mask (was only working if array was 128x128)
* faster startup for IDE (added threading class for importing modules)
* fixed very minor bug in IDE when searching for attributes that don't exist
* fixed minor bug where scripts with syntax errors didn't run but didn't complain either
* IDE FileOpen now tries the folder that the current file is in first
* IDE removed threading class for running scripts

PsychoPy 0.91.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed the problem of stimulus order/depth. Now the default depth is set (more intuitively) by the order of drawing not creating.
* IDE added recent files to file menu
* IDE minor bug fixes
* IDE rewrite of code inspection using wx.py.instrospect

PsychoPy 0.91.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added find dialog to IDE
* added ability of data.FunctionFromStaircase to create unique bins rather than averaging several x values. Give bins='unique' (rather than bins=someInteger). Also fixed very minor issue where this func would only take a list of lists, rather than a single list.

PsychoPy 0.91.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed IDE problem running filenames containing spaces (only necessary on win32)

PsychoPy 0.91.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added reasonable SourceAssistant to IDE
* added a stop button to abort scripts in IDE
* IDE scripts now run as sub process rather than within the main process: slower but safer
* added an autoflushing stdout to psychopy.__init__. Where lots of text is written to stdout this may be a problem, but turing it off means that stdout doesn't get properly picked up by the IDE :-(

PsychoPy 0.91.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* PsychoPy now has its own IDE!! With syntax-highlighting, code-folding and auto-complete!! :-)
* gui.py had to be refactored a little but (I think) should not be noticed by the end user (gui.Dlg is now a subclass of wx.Dialog rather than a modified instance)
* gui.Dlg and DlgFromDict now end up with an attribute .OK that is either True or False
* fixed bug in data.StairHandler that could result in too many trials being run (since v0.89)

PsychoPy 0.90.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* resolved deprecation warning with wxPython (now using "import wx")

PsychoPy 0.90.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* used the new numpy.mgrid commands throughout filters and visual modules
* sorted out the rounding probs on RadialStim
* fixed import bug in calibtools.py

PsychoPy 0.90.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed new bug in the minVal/maxVal handling of StairHandler (where these have not been specified)
* changed the default console log level to be ERROR, due to too much log output!

PsychoPy 0.90.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed new bug in Sound object
* changed the default log file to go to the script directory rather than site-packages/psychopy

PsychoPy 0.90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* sounds now in stereo and a new function to allow you to choose the settings for the sound system.
* LMS colors (cone-isolating stimuli) are now tested and accurate (when calibrated)
* added logging module (errors, warnings, info). And removed other messages:
     * @Verbose@ flags have become log.info messages
     * @Warn@ commands have become log.warning messages
* added minVal and maxVal arguments to data.StairHandler so that range can be bounded
* @import psychopy@ no longer imports anything other than core

Psychopy 0.89.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed bug in new numpy's handling of bits++ header

Psychopy 0.89
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* optimised DotStim to use vertex arrays (can now draw several thousand dots)
* optimised RadialStim to use vertex arrays (can increase radial resolution without much loss)

Psychopy 0.88
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed problem with MonitorCenter on OSX (buttons not working on recent version of wxPython)

Psychopy 0.87
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added sqrXsqr to RadialStim and made it default texture
* fixed a minor bug in RadialStim rendering (stimuli failed to appear under certain stimulus orderings)
* changed RadialStim size parameter to be diameter rather than radius (to be like AlphaStim)
* namechange: introduced PatchStim (currently identical to AlphaStim which may one day become deprecated)

Psychopy 0.86
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* distributed as an .egg

Psychopy 0.85
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* upgraded for numpy1.0b and scipy0.50. Hopefully those packages are now stable enough that they won't need further PsychoPy compatibility changes

Psychopy 0.84
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW (alpha) support for radial patterns rather than linear ones
* changed Clock behaviour to use time.clock() on win32 rather than time.time()
* fixed a bug in the shuffle seeding behaviour
* added a noise pattern to background in monitor calibration

Psychopy 0.83
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW post-install script for Win32 installs shortcuts to your >>Start>Programs menu
* NEW parallel port code (temporary form) using DLportIO.dll can be found under _parallel
* NEW hardware module with support for fORP response box (for MRI) using serial port
* added iterator functionality to data.TrialHandler and data.StairHandler you can now use ::
    for thisTrial in allTrials:

but a consequence was that .nextTrial() will be deprecated in favour of .next().
Also, when the end of the trials is reached a StopIteration is raised.
* added the ability to seed the shuffle mechanism (and trial handler) so you can repeat experiments with the same trial sequence

Psychopy 0.82
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* rewritten code for bits++ LUT drawing, raised by changes in pyOpenGL(2.0.1.09) call to drawpixels
* minor change to exit behaviour. pyGame.quit() is now called and then sys.exit(0) rather than sys.exit(1)
* bug fixes in type handling (from Numeric to numpy)

Psychopy 0.81
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* changes to gui caused by new threading behaviour of wxPython and PyGame (DlgFromDict must now be a class not a function).

Psychopy 0.80
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* switching numeric code to new python24 and new scipy/numpy. MUCH nicer
* new (reduced requirements):
  * numpy 0.9 or newer (the replacement for Numeric/numarray)
  * numpy 0.4.4 or newer
  * pyOpenGL
  * pygame
  * PIL
  * matplotlib (for data plotting)

PsychoPy 0.72
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* tested (and fixed) compatibility with wxPython 2.6. Will now be using this as my primary handler for GUIs
* ADDED ability to quit during run of getLumSeries

PsychoPy 0.71
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED filename bug in makeMovies.makeAnimatedGIF
* slight change to monitors that it uses testMonitor.calib as a default rather than default.calib (testMonitor.calib is packaged with the installation)

PsychoPy 0.70
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED bug in setSize. Wasn't updating correctly
* ADDED ability to append to a data file rather than create new
* bits.lib (from CRS) is now distributed directly with psychopy rather than needing separate install)
* ADDED db/log/linear step methods to StairHandler
* ADDED logistic equation to data.FitFunction

PsychoPy 0.69
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED a testMonitor to the monitors package so that demos can use it for pseudo*calibrated stimuli.
* REDUCED the attempt to use _bits.pyd. Was only necessary for machines that had bits++ monitor center
* ADDED basic staircase method
* CHANGED dlgFromDict to return None on cancel rather than 0
* CHANGED the description of sin textures so that the centre of the patch had the color of dkl or rgb rather
  than the edge. (Effectively all sin textures are now shifted in phase by pi radians).
  -Demos removed from the main package - now ONLY distributed as a separate library

PsychoPy 0.68
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED toFile and fromFile so they work!?
* Demos being distributed as a separate .zip file (may be removed from the main package someday)

PsychoPy 0.67
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED toFile, fromFile, pol2cart functions to psychopy.misc
* CHANGED waitKeys to return a list of keys (usually of length one) so that it's compatible with getKeys

PsychoPy 0.66
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* serial is now a subpackage of psychopy and so doesn't need additional installation
* REMOVED the code to try and query the graphics card about the scr dimensions. From now on, if yo uwish to use real world units, you MUST specify scrWidthPIX and scrWidthCM when you make your visual.Window
* ADDED flag to data output to output matrixOnly (useful for matlab imports)
* REVERTED the default numeric handler to be Numeric rather than numarray (because it looks like numarray hasn't taken off as much as thought)
* FIXED minor bug in text formatting for TrialHandler.saveAsText()
* CHANGED visual.Window so that the monitor argument prefers to receive a Monitor object (rather than just a dictionary) or just the name of one. MonitorCenter makes it so easy to create these now that they should be the default.
* CHANGED Photometer initialisation behaviour - used to raise an error on a fail but now sets an internal attribute .OK to False rather than True

PsychoPy 0.65
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* MonitorCenter now complete. Plots and checks gamma correction.
* can write movies out to animated gifs(any platform) or mpg/avi (both windows only)

PsychoPy 0.64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* CHANGED monitor key dkl_rgb_matrix to dkl_rgb (also for lms)
* ADDED code for PR650 to get the monitor color calibration and calculate the color conversion matrices automatically. Will be implemented via the MonitorCenter application.
* ADDED pyserial2.0 as a subpackage of psychopy so that it needn't be separately installed
* Much improved MonitorCenter with DKL and LMS calibration buttons and matrix output
* Double-click installer for Mac now available

PsychoPy 0.63
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED ability to capture frames from the window as images (tif, jpg...) or as animated GIF files :) see demo
* ADDED ability for elements in DotStim to be any arbitrary stimulus with a methods for .setPos(), .draw()

PsychoPy 0.62
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED the circular mask for DotStim
* FIXED bug in the new text alignment method (was being aligned but not positioned?!)

PsychoPy 0.61
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED minor bug in MonitorCenter (OS X only)

PsychoPy 0.60
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED a GUI application for looking after monitors and calibrations. SEE MonitorCenter.py in the new package monitors
* MOVED "psychopy.calib" subpackage to a whole separate package "monitors". Calibration files will now be stored alongside the calibration code. This makes it easier to develop the new calibration GUI application that I'm working on. Also means that if you delete the psychopy folder for a new installation you won't lose your calibration files.
* ADDED optional maxWait argument to event.waitKeys()
* CHANGED TextStim to take the font as a name rather than font number
* ADDED alignment to text stimuli (alignVert, alignHoriz)
* CHANGED waitKeys to implicitly clear keys from the event queue so that it only finds the first keypress after its called. As result it now returns a single character rather than list of them
* CHANGED visual.Window so that it no longer overrides monitor settings if arguments are specified. Easy now to create a monitor in the monitors GUI and use that instead
* ADDED the circular mask for DotStimulus
