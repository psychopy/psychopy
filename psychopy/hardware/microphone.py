    """Class for recording audio from a microphone or input stream.

    Creating an instance of this class will open a stream using the specified
    device. Streams should remain open for the duration of your session. When a
    stream is opened, a buffer is allocated to store samples coming off it.
    Samples from the input stream will writen to the buffer once
    :meth:`~MicrophoneDevice.start()` is called.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : int or `~psychopy.sound.AudioDevice`
        Audio capture device to use. You may specify the device either by index
        (`int`) or descriptor (`AudioDevice`).
    sampleRateHz : int
        Sampling rate for audio recording in Hertz (Hz). By default, 48kHz
        (``sampleRateHz=48000``) is used which is adequate for most consumer
        grade microphones (headsets and built-in).
    channels : int
        Number of channels to record samples to `1=Mono` and `2=Stereo`.
    streamBufferSecs : float
        Stream buffer size to pre-allocate for the specified number of seconds.
        The default is 2.0 seconds which is usually sufficient.
    maxRecordingSize : int
        Maximum recording size in kilobytes (Kb). Since audio recordings tend to
        consume a large amount of system memory, one might want to limit the
        size of the recording buffer to ensure that the application does not run
        out of memory. By default, the recording buffer is set to 24000 KB (or
        24 MB). At a sample rate of 48kHz, this will result in 62.5 seconds of
        continuous audio being recorded before the buffer is full.
    audioLatencyMode : int or None
        Audio latency mode to use, values range between 0-4. If `None`, the
        setting from preferences will be used. Using `3` (exclusive mode) is
        adequate for most applications and required if using WASAPI on Windows
        for other settings (such audio quality) to take effect. Symbolic
        constants `psychopy.sound.audiodevice.AUDIO_PTB_LATENCY_CLASS_` can also
        be used.
    audioRunMode : int
        Run mode for the recording device. Default is standby-mode (`0`) which
        allows the system to put the device to sleep. However, when the device
        is needed, waking the device results in some latency. Using a run mode
        of `1` will keep the microphone running (or 'hot') with reduces latency
        when th recording is started. Cannot be set when after initialization at
        this time.
    autoPolling : bool
        Allow for automatic polling of the stream. If `True`, data will be 
        polled from the stream in a background thread. If `False`, you will need
        to call `poll()` manually. Default is `True`. Calling `poll()` manually
        when `autoPolling` is `True` will have no effect.
    pollInterval : float
        Interval at which to poll the stream. Should be less than than 
        `streamBufferSecs`. Default is 0.5 seconds.

    Examples
    --------
    Capture 10 seconds of audio from the primary microphone::

        import psychopy.core as core
        import psychopy.sound.Microphone as Microphone

        mic = Microphone(bufferSecs=10.0)  # open the microphone
        mic.start()  # start recording
        core.wait(10.0)  # wait 10 seconds
        mic.stop()  # stop recording

        audioClip = mic.getRecording()

        print(audioClip.duration)  # should be ~10 seconds
        audioClip.save('test.wav')  # save the recorded audio as a 'wav' file

    The prescribed method for making long recordings is to poll the stream once
    per frame (or every n-th frame)::

        mic = Microphone(bufferSecs=2.0)
        mic.start()  # start recording

        # main trial drawing loop
        mic.poll()
        win.flip()  # calling the window flip function

        mic.stop()  # stop recording
        audioClip = mic.getRecording()

    Think of instances of this class behaving like an audio tape whereas the

    written to the tape which stores the data.

    Used internally by the `MicrophoneDevice` class, users usually do not create
    instances of this class themselves.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sampleRateHz : int
        Sampling rate for audio recording in Hertz (Hz). By default, 48kHz
        (``sampleRateHz=48000``) is used which is adequate for most consumer
        grade microphones (headsets and built-in).
    channels : int
        Number of channels to record samples to `1=Mono` and `2=Stereo`.
    maxRecordingSize : int
        Maximum recording size in kilobytes (Kb). Since audio recordings tend to
        consume a large amount of system memory, one might want to limit the
        size of the recording buffer to ensure that the application does not run
        out of memory. By default, the recording buffer is set to 24000 KB (or
        24 MB). At a sample rate of 48kHz, this will result in 62.5 seconds of
        continuous audio being recorded before the buffer is full.
    policyWhenFull : str
        What to do when the recording buffer is full and cannot accept any more
        samples. If 'ignore', samples will be silently dropped and the `isFull`
        property will be set to `True`. If 'warn', a warning will be logged and
        the `isFull` flag will be set. Finally, if 'error' the application will
