class DeviceManager:
    """Class for managing hardware devices.

    An instance of this class is used to manage various hardware peripherals used by PsychoPy. It
    can be used to access devices such as microphones, button boxes, and cameras though a common
    interface. It can also be used to get information about available devices installed on the
    system, such as their settings and capabilities prior to initializing them.
    
    It is recommended that devices are initialized through the device manager rather than
    directly. The device manager is responsible for keeping track of devices and ensuring that
    they are properly closed when the program exits.

    This class is implemented as a singleton, so there is only one instance of it per ssession
    after its initialized. The instance can be accessed through the global variable
    `deviceManager` or by calling `getDeviceManager()`.

    Any subclass of BaseDevice is added to DeviceManager's `.deviceClasses` list upon import,
    so devices matching that class become available through `DeviceManager.getAvailableDevices(
    "*")`.
