This file contains a series of demonstration experiments to be used with the 
Builder interface of PsychoPy (www.psychopy.org).

To run these demos you need to unzip the file to a new folder (on windows you may
be viewing this file from within the zip file, but you should copy the enclosed  
folders to a new directory).

Each demo has further notes about its use and analysis within its folder.

Feel free to submit demos of your own studies to the PsychoPy list so they can be
included here.

Note that the demos presented are generally adaptations from classic studies, 
in which timings and details are likely to differ from the originals.


Cognitive psychology
------------------------

 - Stroop - measuring reaction times to incongruent stimuli
    NB: simple first experiment
    
 - Stroop Extended
    NB: similar to Stroop but shows how to provide feedback and practice trials
    
 - Sternberg (1966) - serial/parallel search in short term memory

 - Navon (1977) - global/local processing in perception

 - branchedExp - OK, this one isn't really an experiment. It just shows how to do branching in the Builder

Psychophysics studies
--------------------------

 - Psychophysics staircase - using a staircase to get a detection threshold


Social Psychology
--------------------------

 - BART - Balloon analogue risk task
    NB: This is a *advanced* demo with lot's of Code Components. It shows how
    flexible PsychoPy can be with some python scripting mixed in.
