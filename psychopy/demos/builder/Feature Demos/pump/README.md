# Syringe Pump Operation: "Bubble Cycle"

**Note: From version 2023s, you would need to first install the plugin Qmix Syringe Pump Support.**

These routines will guide the user through the process of filling a set of Cetoni neMESYS syringe pumps and the removal of air bubbles.

For instructions how to set up the syringe pump system, please refer to the procedure works as follows:
- The spray head is removed, and the inlet tubes are placed in the stimulus reservoirs.
- The syringes are partially filled with liquid. They will also aspirate air, as the inlet tube and valves are filled with air at the beginning of the procedure.
- If one were now to simply empty and re-fill the syringes, some of the air bubbles would always remain trapped at the very tip of the syringes.
Therefore, we apply a small trick here: The inlet tubes are removed from the reservoirs, and the syringes aspirate air again. This causes small air bubbles to burst.
- Then, the tubes are inserted into the reservoirs again, to aspirate more liquid and to remove the air from the tubes.
- The syringes now contain liquid and a substantial amount of air, which is located at the tip of the syringes (which are placed vertically in the pumps).
- Now, the syringes are partially emptied and refilled repeatedly to remove any air from the system and to fill the tubing with liquid.
- When done, the spray head can reattached.
