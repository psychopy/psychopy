Visual search task with eye tracking
====================================

This demo uses an eye tracker to perform a gaze controlled visual search task. 
One of the eye trackers supported by PsychoPy must be used.

When the experiment starts, enter the name of the eye tracker configuration
file to use for the experiment in the 'Eye Tracker Config:' field. 
Example configuration files for GazePoint (gazepoint_config.yaml), 
SR Research (eyelink_config.yaml), and Tobii (tobii_config.yaml) eye trackers
are included. You can edit the eye tracker configuration file
if the default settings are not appropriate for your desired 
system configuration.
  
You may also need to install the SDK (software development kit) or
API (application programming interface) provided by your particular eye tracker
manufacturer.
