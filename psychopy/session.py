class Session:
    """
    A Session is from which you can run multiple PsychoPy experiments, so long
    as they are stored within the same folder. Session uses a persistent Window
    and inputs across experiments, meaning that you don't have to keep closing
    and reopening windows to run multiple experiments.

    Through the use of multithreading, an experiment running via a Session can
    be sent commands and have variables changed while running. Methods of
    Session can be called from a second thread, meaning they don't have to wait
    for `runExperiment` to return on the main thread. For example, you could
    pause an experiment after 10s like so:

    ```
    # define a function to run in a second thread
    def stopAfter10s(thisSession):
        # wait 10s
        time.sleep(10)
        # pause
        thisSession.pauseExperiment()
    # create a second thread
    thread = threading.Thread(
        target=stopAfter10s,
        args=(thisSession,)
    )
    # start the second thread
    thread.start()
    # run the experiment (in main thread)
    thisSession.runExperiment("testExperiment")
    ```

    When calling methods of Session which have the parameter `blocking` from
    outside of the main thread, you can use `blocking=False` to force them to
    return immediately and, instead of executing, add themselves to a queue to
    be executed in the main thread by a while loop within the `start` function.
    This is important for methods like `runExperiment` or
    `setupWindowFromParams` which use OpenGL and so need to be run in the
    main thread. For example, you could alternatively run the code above like
    this:

    ```
    # define a function to run in a second thread
    def stopAfter10s(thisSession):
        # start the experiment in the main thread
        thisSession.runExperiment("testExperiment", blocking=False)
        # wait 10s
        time.sleep(10)
        # pause
        thisSession.pauseExperiment()
    # create a second thread
    thread = threading.Thread(
        target=stopAfter10s,
        args=(thisSession,)
    )
    # start the second thread
    thread.start()
    # start the Session so that non-blocking methods are executed
    thisSession.start()
    ```


    Parameters
    ----------
    root : str or pathlib.Path
        Root folder for this session - should contain all of the experiments to be run.

    liaison : liaison.WebSocketServer
        Liaison server from which to receive run commands, if running via a liaison setup.

    loggingLevel : str
        How much output do you want in the log files? Should be one of the following:
            - 'error'
            - 'warning'
            - 'data'
            - 'exp'
            - 'info'
            - 'debug'
        ('error' is fewest messages, 'debug' is most)

    inputs: dict, str or None
        Dictionary of input objects for this session. Leave as None for a blank dict, or supply the
        name of an experiment to use the `setupInputs` method from that experiment.

    win : psychopy.visual.Window, str or None
        Window in which to run experiments this session. Supply a dict of parameters to make a Window
        from them, or supply the name of an experiment to use the `setupWindow` method from that experiment.

    experiments : dict or None
        Dict of name:experiment pairs which this Session can run. Each should be the file path of a .psyexp
        file, contained somewhere within the folder supplied for `root`. Paths can be absolute or
        relative to the root folder. Leave as None for a blank dict, experiments can be added
        later on via `addExperiment()`.
    
    restMsg : str
        Message to display inbetween experiments.
