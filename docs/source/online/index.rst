Running and sharing studies online
=======================================

In January 2018 we began a `Wellcome Trust <http://www.wellcome.ac.uk>`_ grant to make online studies possible from PsychoPy. This is what we call PsychoPy3 - the 3rd major phase of PsychoPy's development.

The key steps to this are basically to:

- generate a JavaScript experiment ready to run online
- upload it to Pavlovia.org to be launched
- set up your recruitment procedure

Those steps are covered in detail here:
