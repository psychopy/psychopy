Consultancy services
======================

We will continue offering as much technical support as possible for free via the `forum <https://discourse.psychopy.org>`_ as well as offering `free training events <https://workshops.psychopy.org/3hrs/index.html>`_. However, if you're **short on time but have spare funds**, or you are **seeking some specific training** you can also hire bespoke support direct from the |PsychoPy| team. For enquiries please contact consultancy@opensciencetools.org.


What can we offer?
--------------------------------

Our rate for Science Officer support is £70 per hour +VAT, we usually start by scoping your project to give you an exact quote.

We can be quite flexible in what we offer, but to give you an idea of what is possible:

*	**Task creation** -  Short on time but have spare funds? Need a task creating? Our team of experts can help create a task to fit your brief.
*	**Debugging assistance**  - Have you developed a task that needs a few tweaks you are stuck on? In general we try to offer as much support for this for free via the `forum <https://discourse.psychopy.org>`_    but if you want to enhance your learning via one-to-one or small group chats get in touch!
*	**Small group training**  -  If you and your lab group would like to learn PsychoPy or focus on about specific aspects of |PsychoPy| (for example learn how to create a specific type of task), we can tailor something for you.
*  **Departmental demo** -  Thinking of getting a Pavlovia license? We offer a **free** 1 hour departmental demo. For more details, please  email workshops@opensciencetools.org
