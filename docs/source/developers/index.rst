For Developers
=====================================

The best place to discuss ideas in depth is probably the dedicated 
`developers section of the forum <https://discourse.psychopy.org/c/dev/10>`_

For developers the best way to use |PsychoPy| is to install a version to your
own copy of python (preferably 3.8 or 3.9 but we try to support a reasonable range).
Make sure you have all the dependencies, including the extra
suggested packages for developers.

Don't *install* |PsychoPy|. Instead fetch a copy of the git repository and add
this to the python path using a .pth file. Other users of the computer might 
have their own standalone versions installed without your repository version 
touching them.
