Testimonials - what do people think of |PsychoPy|?
=====================================================

OK, so we know that `PsychoPy has quite a lot of users <https://usage.psychopy.org>`_

We also know that quite a few people have written `manuscripts that cited |PsychoPy|
<http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cites=18194791051729814045&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en>`_ 

But did the users actually *enjoy* using the software or was it a painful experience? 
This page will hold the (roughly honest) opinions of `users <https://psychopy.org/about/testimonials.html#psychopy-as-a-tool>`_, `workshop attendees <https://psychopy.org/about/testimonials.html#workshops>`_ and `consultancy clients <https://psychopy.org/about/testimonials.html#consultancy-services>`_.

(Updating the testimonials will be done periodically so don't expect your comment to appear here instantly, 
but we'll try and remember to do it every now and then. Please don't swear!!)
