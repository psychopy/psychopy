    <hr>Not only was the workshop efficiently organised and effectively adapted to our department’s individual needs, but Rebecca’s delivery was engaging and flexible. Her passion for research integrity and open science were evident throughout and she went above and beyond to ensure that we had enough direction and guidance to achieve our research aims. I would definitely recommend the workshop to anyone who is planning to use Pavlovia or Psychopy within their department!<p>

    <hr>I can highly recommend the PsychoPy team for a workshop at your school or department.  The sessions they ran for us here at LJMU were well paced and catered for researchers with range of experience levels.  Rebecca and Kimberley tailored the content where appropriate to align with our research needs, and well as learning a lot, we all had a lot of fun in the process.  As a result, a growing number of researchers in the School are running online research projects over Pavlovia and have moved much of our lab based research over to PsychoPy as well.<p>
