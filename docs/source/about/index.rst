Citing these papers gives the reviewer/reader of your study information about how the system works and it attributes some credit for its original creation. Academic assessment (whether for promotion or even getting appointed to a job in the first place) prioritises publications over making useful tools for others. Citations provide a way for the developers to justify their continued involvement in the development of the package.
