    <hr>I unconditionally recommend Open Science Tools in setting up cognitive tasks in the PsychoPy environment. We have used their service multiple times, and their workflow is reliable, prompt, and reasonable in cost, with excellent developer support. I hope to use their services for every instance needing the development of code for psychometric testing.<p>

    <hr>Sue Lynn was able to create a complex experiment on PsychoPy that I would never have been able to work out on my own! Thanks so much<p>

    <hr>I am delighted to share my experience with Open Science Tools. After an initial consultation, the team started working on putting together an experimental paradigm that is suitable for our research. Although the paradigm we required was complex in nature, Becca remained open-minded and was able to deliver exactly what we needed. She kept in regular contact with us and took considerable time to hand over the paradigm and provide clear and coherent explanations of the different elements. As a researcher who values the principles of Open Science, I am grateful for the positive impact that Open Science Tools has had on my research and the collaborative opportunities that this has led to. I wholeheartedly recommend this consultancy service to other researchers.<p>

    <hr>I have worked with PsychoPy Consultancy on three distinct projects now, and can safely say they are the most knowledgeable, timely and reliable team I have ever worked with. They provide incredibly helpful suggestions about all aspects of the project, from experimental design to computational analysis of the data. They are clearly very knowledgeable and understand cognitive neuroscience and data analytics. The platform itself allows development of complex experiments but in a simple, easy-to-use interface, with seamless integration with devices, multi-session testing protocols and online platforms. Nothing is too complicated for this team! I enthusiastically recommend PsychoPy Consultancy to anyone interested in building a new experiment or modifying an existing one. <p>

    <hr>I worked with Becca to design an extremely complex experimental paradigm.  In short, I wanted a twenty-four-minute continuous search task where items would enter the screen at random locations, drift across the screen along random vectors, and disappear when they reached the other side of the screen.  But there were many caveats:  each item had to travel a substantial distance eliminating some potential vectors, each item had to traverse its trajectory in 6 seconds (regardless of the length of the trajectory), and the display always had to have 24 items visible (one exiting the screen every 250 ms while another appeared).  We also needed to have occasional target stimuli and needed to track target detections, reaction times, and the location on the screen occupied by the target when they were detected.  The programming required was extremely challenging and I was at a loss.  Becca’s considerable programming skill made short work of the programming.  She worked quickly to set up a beta version of the task, was willing to let us play with it, and then met (via zoom) to discuss possible alterations or concerns we had.   However, what was most impressive was that she had an excellent understanding of experimental methods and the need for experimental controls, which made communication about the parameters of the task easy and efficient.  All in all, it was a great experience, and in terms of the time it saved me in programming, well worth the nominal cost.   I would definitely use their services again anytime I had an experiment that was going to be difficult to program!<p>

    <hr>When I reached out to PsychoPy I was able to connect with someone and get help with my program almost immediately. I worked with Sue, who did an amazing job with creating my program based on my needs and requirements. I was also able to get additional training on how the program was made. She was also available via email for any follow up questions I had. I think the services provided by Sue and the rest of the team are great and I would highly recommend their services to anyone, especially those who know very little about coding.  <p>

    <hr>The team at Open Science Tools provides outstanding services. When I needed one-on-one video consultations for my research project, they were very accommodating and helped me understand connections among PsychoPy, Pavlovia, and PsychoJS. Their consultants have always provided quick and productive email responses when I’ve needed troubleshooting for my experiment’s code. And, when I’m developing the code for a new experiment, I often find solutions on their PsychoPy online forum. I’m grateful to Open Science Tools for creating these resources, which I use for my research program and my classroom teaching.<p>
