Resources (e.g. for teaching)
=====================================

There are a number of further resources to help learn/teach about PsychoPy.

If you also have PsychoPy materials/course then please let us know so that we can link to them from here too!

Workshops
---------------------------------------------------------------

At Nottingham we run an annual workshop on Python/PsychoPy (ie. programming, not Builder). Please see the page on :ref:`officialWorkshops` for further details.

Youtube tutorials
-----------------

- There is our `YouTube PsychoPy playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFB5A1BE51964D587>`_
  showing how to build basic experiments in the :ref:`builder` interface.
- Jason Ozubko has added a series of great `PsychoPy Builder video tutorials`_ too
- Damien Mannion added a similarly great series of `PsychoPy programming videos on YouTube`_
- ... and a `searching YouTube for PsychoPy <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=psychopy>`_
  reveals many more!

Materials for Builder
---------------------

- The **most comprehensive guide** is the book `Building Experiments in PsychoPy`_ by Peirce and MacAskill.
  The book is suitable for a wide range of needs and skill sets, with 3 sections for:

    - The Beginner (suitable for undergraduate teaching)
    - The Professional (more detail for creating more precise studies)
    - The Specialist (with info about specialist needs such as studies in fMRI, EEG, ...)

- At `School of Psychology, University of Nottingham`_, PsychoPy is now used for all first year practical class teaching. The classes that comprise that first year course are provided below. They were created partially with funding from the former `Higher Education Academy Psychology Network`_. Note that the materials here will be updated frequently as they are further developed (e.g. to update screenshots etc) so make sure you have the latest version of them!

        `PsychoPy_pracs_2011v2.zip (21MB) <PsychoPy_pracs_2011v2.zip>`_ (last updated: 15 Dec 2011)

- The `GestaltReVision group (University of Leuven) wiki <http://gestaltrevision.be/wiki/python>`_ covering PsychoPy (some Builder info and great tutorials for Python/PsychoPy coding of experiments).
- There's a set of tools for `teaching psychophysics using PsychoPy <https://github.com/jamesferwerda/PsychoPysics>`_
  and a `PsychoPysics poster from VSS <https://github.com/jamesferwerda/PsychoPysics/blob/master/ferwerda18_vss_poster.key.pdf>`_.
  Thanks `James Ferwerda <https://jamesferwerda.wordpress.com>`_

Materials for Coder
-------------------

- Please see the page on :ref:`officialWorkshops` for further details on coming
  to an intensive residential Python workshop in Nottingham.
- Marco Bertamimi's book, `Programming Illusions for Everyone`_ is a fun way to
  learn about stimulus rendering in PsychoPy by learning how to create visual illusions
- `Gary Lupyan <http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/>`_ runs a class on programming
  experiments using Python/PsychoPy and makes his lecture materials available
  `on this wiki <http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Psych711>`_
- The `GestaltReVision group (University of Leuven) <http://gestaltrevision.be>`_
  offers a `three-day crash course to Python and PsychoPy on a IPython Notebook
  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gestaltrevision/python_for_visres/blob/master/index.ipynb>`_,
  and has lots of great information taking you from basic programming to advanced techniques.
- Radboud University, Nijmegen also has a
  `PsychoPy programming course <https://www.socsci.ru.nl/~wilberth/nocms/psychopy/print.php>`_
- `Programming for Psychology in Python - Vision Science <http://www.djmannion.net/programming_vision>`_
  has lessons and screencasts on PsychoPy (by `Damien Mannion <http://www.djmannion.net/>`_, UNSW Australia).
