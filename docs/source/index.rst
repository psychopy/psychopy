PsychoPy is an open-source application allowing you run a wide range of
neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments.

PsychoPy aims to be:

- *Easy* enough for teaching
- *Precise* enough for psychophysics
- *Flexible* enough for everything else!

To achieve these goals PsychoPy provides a unique choice of interface: use the
**Builder interface** to build rich, flexible experiments easily or use the
**Coder interface** to write extremely powerful experiments in the widely-used
*Python* programming language. The best of both worlds!
