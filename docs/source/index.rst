PsychoPy is an open-source application to allow the presentation of stimuli and collection of data for a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM|, written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).

News
====================

**Latest version**: 1.80.02 was released April 2014, with many improvements to the user interface (e.g. dialog boxes), more precise degrees of visual angle (optionally correct for flat panels) and many bug fixes

See complete :doc:`changelog` for complete list of additions and fixes

**Upcoming Workshops**:
    
    :ref:`P4N`
    
        There will be a 3-day Python Workshop 28-20th April 2014 at Nottingham University, with **novice** and **intermediate** streams. We'll follow that with 2 days of a 'code sprint' for developers of PsychoPy. You can book **before 14th April** (or until all places are filled) at `Nottingham's online store <http://store.nottingham.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&catid=49&prodid=323>`_
