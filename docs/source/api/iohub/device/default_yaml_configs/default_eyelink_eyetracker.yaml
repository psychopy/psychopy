    # name: The unique name to assign to the device instance created.
    #   The device is accessed from within the PsychoPy script 
    #   using the name's value; therefore it must be a valid Python
    #   variable name as well.

    name: tracker

    # enable: Specifies if the device should be enabled by ioHub and monitored
    #   for events.
    #   True = Enable the device on the ioHub Server Process
    #   False = Disable the device on the ioHub Server Process. No events for
    #   this device will be reported by the ioHub Server.

    #   or if events should only start to be monitored on the device when a call to the
    #   device's enableEventReporting method is made with a parameter value of True.

        # IMPORTANT: Note that while the gaze position data provided by ioHub
        # will be in the Display's coordinate system, the EyeLink internally
        # always uses a 0,0 pixel_width, pixel_height coordinate system
        # since internally calibration point positions are given as integers,
        # so if the actual display coordinate system was passed to EyeLink,
        # coordinate types like deg and norm would become very coarse in
        # possible target locations during calibration.
        
        # type: sr_research.eyelink.EyeTracker supports the following

        auto_pace: True

        # pacing_speed: The number of sec.msec that a calibration point should
        # be displayed before moving onto the next point when auto_pace is set to true.

        #   set the calibration, validation, etc, screens to. Each element of the color
        #   should be a value between 0 and 255. 0 == black, 255 == white. In general
        #   the last value of the color list (alpha) can be left at 255, indicating
