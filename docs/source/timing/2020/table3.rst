Table3: online timing data
==============================


This is a sortable version of Table3 from
`The timing mega-study: comparing a range of experiment generators, both lab-based and online <https://psyarxiv.com/d6nu5/>`_


**Timing summaries of web-based software** by package, platform, and browser.
The Var(iability) measures are the inter-trial standard deviations of the
various latencies for that configuration. The table is sorted by the mean
of those variabilities (Mean Var). The Lag/Bias measures are the mean
latency values, for that configuration. In the case of audiovisual sync,
a negative bias indicates the audio lead the visual stimulus, a positive
bias means the visual lead the audio. Each of the values with a hyperlink
will lead to a plot of the distribution of values leading to that summary value.
